  "body": "   Physical science is an introductory book for non-scinece major students. It consists of introduction of physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in physical science course. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some high school mathematical skills such as algebra and geometry.  Learning skills by memorization cannot work efficiently in learning physical sciences. It is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into ten chapters that covers the syllabus of physical science at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. The topics in this book have been carefully selected to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of science and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted. - - Author  "

  "title": "Significant Figures",
  "body": " Significant Figures    significant figures Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be 287.5 cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the first digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) he\/she could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the first digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter how accuratly you measure things, there is always some inaccuracy in every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.    1000 has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000. : notice that ”point” after the zero! This has four significant digits, because the decimal point tells us that the measurement was made to the nearest unit, so the zero is not just a placeholder.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the ”.0” tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then If it had four sig. fig. then 200.0 is sufficient.    Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:  All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.  All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.  Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number ”540” there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.  Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.  Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped. If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it. If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded. If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error.    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).     Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to ”place” the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.     Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits:   For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is ”odd” and followed by a ”5”, then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits.  For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is ”even” and followed by a ”5”, then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.        Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures    Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as:  Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures as      Science and Religion  Science is a study of understanding the natural phenomena based on observation and experimental evidence acquired by scientific method. It is always skeptical and never correct to 100%.  Religion on the other hand is understanding the purpose, source, and meaning of our world based on faith. Many principles are accepted without asking any question.   "

  "title": "Ancient Observations",
  "body": " Ancient Observations     Solar System      We have been observing sky solar system since the begining of human history. It seems that the sun is revolving around the earth. On such observation the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD came up with the idea of Geocentric Theory in which unmoving earth is at the center of the universe and the sun is revolving around it. He was able to predict fairly accurate positions of celectial objects and his theory was the longest ever (about 2500 years) accepted theory of universe. However, his theory was not able to explain Retrograde Motion correctly.    Retrograde Motion  Sometimes celestial objects such as some planets appear to move backwardly in their orbit around the sun as shown in the animation below. Retrograde Motion Please click on start button in the animation. In the animation retrograde motion is shown for the planet \"Mars\". The projection of mars in the sky is shown by the background stars. We notice that when mars reaches to certain positions it looks suddenly moving backward as seen from the earth and after some time in the year it again starts moving forward in its orbit around the sun. Such an apparent reverse motion of the planets is called retrograde motion. Ptolmy's geocentric theory was not able to explain this event very cleary. So in 1543, Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus publish revised but completly radical theory called Heliocentric Theory . In this theory the unmovable sun at the center of the universe and all the planets are moving around it in the specific oribit. This theory was able to solve almost all the puzzles of the time. In heliocentric model of the solar system Copernicus proposed that the Earth has three distinct motions: a daily axial rotation, an annual rotation about the Sun, and a precessional motion of its axis.    Tides  The regular rise and fall of ocean water is called tides.Tides are water waves that occur naturally in ocean due to force of gravity on earth surface due to the moon and the sun. Please watch this video to understand the tides. Tide Formation Because of moon's gravity water bulges out of the earth surface and keep getting dragged as the moon moves around the earth. The effect of moon's gravity is more on the earth surface than the sun's gravity due to their distant positions. When sun and moon are located along the same direction high tide is higher than normal high tide and low tide is lower than normal low tide and they are collectivly called Spring Tide . When sun and moon are at right angles to each other than high tide and low tide both are shorter than usual and they are called Neep Tide . There are alawyes two high and two low tides in every 24 hours.    Some more observations  In the animation window, observe some more natural phenomena and prepare your own hypotheses. celestial sphere The yellow circle in the animation is called an Ecliptic line. It is an apparent path of the sun in the sky as viewed from the earth over the course of a year.   "

  "title": "Units and Measurements",
  "body": " Units and Measurements   Physics endeavors to decipher natural laws. In order to describe a natural law (or physical law) a measurement of varieties of physical quantities are essential. measurement Measurement is a process that uses numbers and units to describe a physical quantity based on what can be observed. A physical property which can be quantified and measured in numbers is called a physical quantity physical quantity. Length, mass, time, weight, temperature, density, speed, velocity, etc are physical quantities. Emotions, angers, feelings, appearances, etc which can not be quantized are not considered as physical quantities. In order to measure physical quantities some standard measures (or standards) must be defined on which everyone can agree. Standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement. We can measure things by compering them with the standards. Units of measurement provide standards for comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. A meter stick is an example of a standard. When something is measured with a meterstick, we compare their similar property with the meterstick. For example, if we measure a height of a pillar with a meterstick and found that height to be 6 meter then 6 is a number of times meterstick used in the measurement and meter is a unit (or length) of meterstick. This makes measurement easier and uniform.  There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether known as the base quantities. Their units are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. The diverse human history and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and CGS (centimeter gram second). The FPS system of units is also called British system and MKS system is also called a metric system. The metric system is a decimalized system of measurement developed in France in late century. Since the metric system is almost universally used, it is often referred to as the International System of Units and abbreviated SI. Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in table below.   The Systems of Units    Base Quantity  SI Units  SI Symbol    Mass  Kilogram  kg    Length  Meter  m    Time  Second  s    Amount of Substance  Mole  mol    Electric Current  Ampere  A    Temperature  Kelvin  K    Luminous Intensity  Candela  cd       Derived Units  Derived quantities are defined in terms of mathematical relation between the base quantities.     .

  "title": "Describing Motion",
  "body": " Describing Motion     Distance: It is the length between the change in positions of an object. If is an initial position of the object and is a final position of that object then is the distance travelled by the object. It is a scalar quantity because it does not deal with the direction in which the object is travelling.It's unit is in SI system and in CGS system, and in FPS system.  Displacement: It is a direct distance between initial and final position of the object. It is the shortest path between initial and final positions of the object. It has the same unit as distance. It is a vector quantity because it has only one particular direction between the initial and position of the object. Let's understand by the example here, suppose you started travelling from initial point A and reached to point B by travelling 4 m distance along east. Now from point B you covered a distance of 3 m along north to reach to your final point C. So the direct distance between your initial position and final position is 5m given by Pythagoras theorem along north-east. Displacement, AC= . See the figure below as reference.  Displacement vector      Speed:The rate of change of position of an object is called a speed. It states that how fast the object is changing its position with respedt to time. In physics, the rate means with respect to time. It is also a scalar quantity. speed is represented by the letter, . If is an initial position and is the final position of the object then . It's unit is m\/s in SI system and cm\/s in CGS system, and ft\/s in FPS system.  Velocity: It is the speed of an object in particular direction. It is a vector quantity. It has the same unit as speed. It is also represented by the letter, .  Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity is called an acceleration. It states that how fast the velocity of an object is being changed. It is also a vector quantity. If is an initial velocity and is the final velocity of the object then the acceleration of the object is given by . It's unit is in SI system. If acceleration is positive then the object is speeding up, if it is negative then the object is slowing down, if it is zero then the object is either moving with uniform velocity or remains at rest. Note: Velocity is always in the same direction as the object is moving, but the acceleration is not.    Vector quantity carries two pieces of information, i.e. magnitude and direction. Vector is often represented by an arrow. A straight line with an arrowhead where the length of the line yields information about MAGNITUDE and the arrow indicates the DIRECTION. Mathematical operation is different for vectors than in scalars. It is not just the addition or subtraction of the numbers. We are not going to perform many vector mathematical operations here rather we try to understand addition and subtraction with some simple examples. Addition or subtraction of scalar quantities are just like adding or subtracting the numbers. In vector addition, the vectors are arranged in “HEAD TO TAIL” to find the sum of the vectors. In vector subtraction, the vector to be subtracted is flipped in direction and added to the other vector by arranging them in “HEAD TO TAIL” to find the sum of the vectors.     For example: in , the total distance travelled by the object is However, total displacement of the object is only along north-east directin as shown by the arrow AC. . Suppose water is flowing downstream with velocity 2 in a river where you are rowing your boat with 5 downstream. You can find that you are moving with 7 velocity (or speed) downstream. If you want to go upsteam then your velocity (or speed) would be 3 only. If you want to row accross the river then your velocity would be somewhere between 3 to 7 . . Suppose Aron is sweeming in a pool of 100 m wide. He took 5 laps, so he covers total of but his displacement is just zero. Remember one lap is one complete round of trip. However, if he just take a half lap then the distance covered is the same as displacement and are 100 m. .      Equations of Motion  There are three equations of motion defined by the above terminologies which can help solve problems of motion. These eqations are obtained by manipulating average velocity and acceleration of the object.     Equations of motion in horizontal direction:   .  .  .    Equations of motion in vertical direction:   .  .  .      Note: The above equations only work for constant acceleration or acceleration due to gravity.  Here, = acceleration due to gracvity, = height attains be the object, and = time taken by the object during its motion.   In vertical direction earth plays a vitol role in the acceleration of object motion. Earth pulls every thing downwards which causes acceleration due to gravity, negative. Accleration due to gravity is the acceleration of the object caused by the earth gravitational field. The value of . In vertical motion, we consider height as positive if going up (y-axis) and height as negative if coming down. But here, we are taking if the object is going vertically up, and for the object falling down. Such conventions allow us to assume h as always positive.   Free Fall  Objects moving under the influence of gravity only is called a free fall. This means gravity causes a change in the velocity of any object by 9.80 every second. So, drop any object and let it fall toward the ground: After 1s, the speed of the object is 9.80 . After 2s, the speed of the object is 19.6 . Etc. According to Galileo the velocity of a falling object is proportional to the length of time that the object has been falling. From the first equation of motion or, as is constant. Hence, the object is falling with higher velocity if it is falling for a long time or from a higher position. Since is constant near the planet all objects fall at the same rate. (Assuming there is no air resistance).    Projectile Motion  In normal day life, we encounter many examples where object moves along both horizontal and verticle direction together. Such type of motion is called projectile motion and the object moving in projectile motion is called a projectile. Hence, projectile is an object which has both horizontal as well as vertical motion. The path taken by the projectile is parabolic in nature. We are not dealing with mathematical operation related to projectile motion here but we try to understand the projectile motion by the following figure.  Projectile motion    Since gravity only acts on the verticle direction the horizontal velocity remains constant always in projectile motion.   "

  "body": " Force   Force is a push or pull. It is a vector quantity. Force is anything that produces a change in the state of motion or shape of an object. Action of force on an object can change the direction of motion or change the velocity of the object. Newton ( ) is an SI unit of force. There are four fundamental forces in nature. They are   Gravitational force or Force of Gravity: The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., Foece, = weight = . Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Weight: It is the force acting on an object due to gravitational acceleration. Weight is the effect of force of gravity on an object located at a particular point. One kg of mass has a weight of about 10 N ( ).    Electromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force exists due to the charge in the object. It is also a long range force but stronger than the gravitational force. It holds all the atoms and molecules together. We discuss this force later in another chapter.    Strong nucleur force: The strong nucleur force is a short range force and it exists only inside the nucleus. It binds all the nucleons together to have atomic existance. It is the strongest force in nature.    Weak nuclear force: The weak nucleur force is also short range force and only exists inside the nucleus. It is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is responsible for radioactivity of nucleous. The improper ratio of nucleons may cause the weak nuclear force to exist.     Physical contact of the object is not necessary to experience the fundamental forces. Hoverever, there are many other forces which only act on the object if they are in contact. They are called contact forces (or mechanical forces). Frictional force, normal force, tension, drag force, applied force, etc. are some contact forces.    Contact Forces     Friction: Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., or, . Where proportionality constant is called the coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces of contact. Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence.  In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in figure below. Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.  Surfaces of contact as seen from microscope      In real life frictional forces are almost always present. Remember the direction of frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion or the applied force. Friction is bad as it dissipates energy but friction is also good as it allows us to roll, turn, walk, and stop. Friction between two solids does not depend on the surface area in contact. Friction can happen, even between surfaces that are not solid such as air drag. Air resistance (drag) during free fall reduces the weight of the object. Air drag increases with the velocity of the object in free fall and when it becomes equal to the wight of the object net force acting on the object is zero and hence the object starts falling with the constant velocity called Terminal Velocity. Sky diving is a good example of terminal velocity.  Skydiving at terminal velocity         Normal: This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension: This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the point of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. Any material has elastic property which helps it to restore its shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, spring force, where k is a spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant and is stretch made on spring.       Newton's Laws of Motion  Newton recognized that there are two kinds of motion they are uniform motion and accelerated motion. Uniform motion: the movement of an object traveling in a straight line at a constant speed (no acceleration). Accelerated motion: the movement of an object traveling under the influence of some source of acceleration. On that basis he defined three laws of motion called Newton's laws of motion.  Newton's first law is the definition of a force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in uniform motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied to it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion. The first law is also called a law of inertia . Inertia is an ability of an object to resist any changes in its motion. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change the state of rest or motion of an object. Mass: It is the amount of matter in contained in an object. It is also reposible for the force of gravity of the object. Some examples of I law: 1. When the bus driver abruptly applies the breaks, passengers tend to feel a momentary pull in the forward direction. The reason behind this jerk felt by the passengers sitting inside the bus is the law of inertia. Due to inertia, our upper body part continues to maintain a state of motion even after the bus stops, thereby pushing us in the forward direction. 2. A book kept on a bookshelf does not change its shape, size, or position until acted upon by an external force. 3. A runner is not able to stop himself right after crossing the finish line. He\/She tends to take time and cover a few meters of distance running beyond the finish line. This is because the inertia of motion resists a sudden termination of motion and compels the body to maintain its state of motion.  Newton's second law is the measurement of a force which states that the acceleration of the object is directly proportional to the applied force and takes the direction of that force. Newton's II law can be expressed as . Where is the mass of the object.  Newton's third law is the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Force always comes in pair. If an object A applies the action force on the object B then object B also applies the same amount of reaction force on the object A. These forces pair always act on two different objects. If one object exerts a force on a second object, then the second object exerts an equal but oppositely directed force on the first object. Mathematically,  Some examples: 1. Earth exerts force on you because you exert an equal and opposite force on earth. Here your force is your body weight and earth reaction force is a normal force. 2. When the rifle is fired it exerts a force on the bullet and the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the rifle. 3. You are able to sweem in water because you pushes water backwardly so apply the force on water and in reaction water also applies the same force on you just in opposite direction so you can sweem nicely.     Momentum  It is the quantity of motion contained in a body. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then its momentum, . Momentum is represented by , it is a vector quantity, and its SI unit is .  From Newton's II law:   Here is called impulse and is called change in momentum. They are two different physical quantities but their magnitude remains the same.   A 300 kg horse running with 40 m\/s has a momentum of     When a 430 g soccer ball is kicked, the impact lasts for 0.04 s. Find the magnitude of force that is needed to fly off the ball at 8 m\/s.          Uniform Circular Motion  In uniform circular motion an object is moving at a constant speed (not velocity) on a circular path. For an object to be in uniform circular motion, there must be a net force acting on it. This force is called a centripetal force without this force nothing can move in a circular path. This net force is not a physical force of some kind actually some other forces must be there to act like a centripetel force. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle. The centripetal force, where is mass of the object, is speed of the object, and is radius of the circluar path. Because of necessary centripetal force, sometime we feel difficulty to steer our car around a sharp curve. The sharper the curve (i.e., the smaller the radius) the greater the centripetal force required to keep the car on the curved path. Cetripetal means to look towards the center, hence centripetal force is always acting towards the center of the path. Some examples: 1. We may have noticed that when the string breaks for a whirling stone. The stone flies off along the straight line tangential to the circular path. 2. When swinging a yo-yo around in a circle. The force generated by your arm puts the yo-yo itself in motion, and the tension on the string keeps it moving in a circular path as you twirl it. If the string were to break at any given point, the yo-yo would fly off in a direction that is tangent to the point on the circle that the yo-yo was at when the string broke centripetal force .    Newton's Law of Gravitation  Newton observed that when an object falls it was accelerated toward the earth. Since the cause of such acceleration is an unbalanced force, there must be a force pulling that object toward the earth. On this basis, he came up with an idea called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It states that any two masses in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, . Here, is an universal gravitational constant, and are the masses of two objects, and is the distance between the two masses.    Gravitational Force between two Objects       "

  "body": " Work, Energy, and Power    Work: If an object is displaced along the same direction as of the applied force then work is said to be done by the force. In the figure below force is pushing a block of mass along its direction for a distance of , then work done, by this force can be calculated by . Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy from one object to another. The SI unit of work is Joule . In FPS system, , and in CGS system, are the work units.   Work done by the forces    Work done by the force     Work done by the slanted force        A horizontal force of moves a block of mass along a horizontal direction for a distance of . How much work is done by the force?         In figure (a) force is along the direction of horizontal and the block is also displaced along the same direction from point A to point B. In this case work done by the force is given by multiplication of force and the displacement . In this figure work done by the weight and normal force is zero as these forces are perpendicular to the displacement . However, in figure (b) work done by the slanted force is not zero but can be determined by the projected force which is not in the scope of this book. Remember for work to be done, foce and displacemenet must be non-zero. Work may be positive, negative, and zero. For example: work done by applied force along the direction of displacement is positive, work done by the frictional force is negative, and work done by the force perpendicular to the displacement is zero.  Energy: The capacity of doing work by a force is called an energy. It is also a scalar quantity and has the same unit as work. There are many forms of energy, but they all fall into two categories: potential energy and kinetic energy. These energies are also called a mechanical energy. Potential energy is the energy of position of the object. It is also a stored energy on the object which is equal to the work done on the object to bring it to this position. There are several forms of potential energy, including: gravitational potential energy, chemical energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, sound energy, heat energy, light energy, geothermal energy, etc. Chemical energy: It is energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. It is the energy that holds these particles together. Foods, biomass, petroleum, and natural gas are some examples of stored chemical energy. During photosynthesis, sunlight gives plants the energy they need to build complex chemical compounds. When these compounds are later broken down, the stored chemical energy is released as heat, light, motion, and sound. Elastic energy: It is an energy stored in objects by the application of a restoring force. Compressed springs and stretched rubber bands are examples of elastic energy. Nuclear energy: It is an energy stored in the nucleus of an atom that binds the nucleus together. The energy can be released when the nuclei are combined or split apart. Nuclear power plants split the nuclei of uranium atoms in a process called fission reaction fission reaction . The sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion reaction fusion reaction . In both the fission and fusion reactions, mass is converted into energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy principle. Gravitational potential energy: or Potential energy: It is the energy of position or place. It is the work done in lifting an object against gravity near the earth's surface. It is given by . Here is the weight of the object and distance is the height at which the object is lifted. A rock resting at the top of a hill contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. In hydropower dam, water in the reservoir stored a gravitational potential energy. Kinetic energy: It is the energy of a body due to its motion. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then kinetic energy is given by, .    Work-Energy Theorem  Let us apply Newton's II law into II equation of motion and rearange them. Here, is final kinetic energy and is initial kinetic energy. Hence, is change in kinetic energy. Therefore, work done = change in kinetic energy. This is known as work-energy theorem. Meaning the amount of work is done on a body is equal to its change in kinetic energy or vice a versa along the straight line.    power  The rate of doing work is called power. Its SI unit is Watt.
