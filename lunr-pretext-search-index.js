  "title": "Preface",
  "body": "   Physical science is an introductory book for non-scinece major students. It consists of introduction of physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in physical science courses. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some high school mathematical skills such as algebra and geometry.  Learning skills by memorization cannot work efficiently in learning physical sciences. It is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into ten chapters that covers the syllabus of physical science at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. The topics in this book have been carefully selected to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of science and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking. The main objective of this book is to inform how to investigate and approach problems in introductory level sciences. This book strives to guide readers to learn physical science in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition. This is an interactive online book and to take full benefit of the book, you may need internet access.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully appreciated.  "

  "title": "Significant Figures",
  "body": " Significant Figures    significant figures Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be 287.5 cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the first digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) he\/she could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the first digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter how accuratly you measure things, there is always some inaccuracy in every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.    1000 has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000. : notice that ”point” after the zero! This has four significant digits, because the decimal point tells us that the measurement was made to the nearest unit, so the zero is not just a placeholder.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the ”.0” tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then If it had four sig. fig. then 200.0 is sufficient.    Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:  All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.  All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.  Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number ”540” there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.  Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.  Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped. If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it. If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded. If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error.    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).     Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to ”place” the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.     Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits:   For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is ”odd” and followed by a ”5”, then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits.  For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is ”even” and followed by a ”5”, then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.        Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures    Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as:  Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures as      Science and Religion  Science is a study of understanding the natural phenomena based on observation and experimental evidence acquired by scientific method. It is always skeptical and never correct to 100%. Religion on the other hand is understanding the purpose, source, and meaning of our world based on faith. Many principles are accepted without asking any question.   "

  "title": "Ancient Observations",
  "body": " Ancient Observations   We have been observing sky solar system since the begining of human history. It seems that the sun is revolving around the earth. On such observation the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD came up with the idea of Geocentric Theory in which unmoving earth is at the center of the universe and the sun is revolving around it. He was able to predict fairly accurate positions of celectial objects and his theory was the longest ever (about 2500 years) accepted theory of universe. However, his theory was not able to explain Retrograde Motion correctly.    Retrograde Motion  Sometimes celestial objects such as some planets appear to move backward in their orbit around the sun as shown in the animation below. Retrograde Motion Please click on start button in the animation. In the animation retrograde motion is shown for the planet \"Mars\". The projection of mars in the sky is shown by the background stars. We notice that when mars reaches certain positions it looks suddenly moving backward as seen from the earth and after some time in the year it again starts moving forward in its orbit around the sun. Such an apparent reverse motion of the planets is called retrograde motion. Ptolmy's geocentric theory was not able to explain this event cleary. So in 1543, Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus publish revised but completly radical theory called Heliocentric Theory . In this theory the unmovable sun at the center of the universe nd all the planets are moving around it in the specific oribit. This theory was able to solve almost all the puzzles of the time. In heliocentric model of the solar system Copernicus proposed that the Earth has three distinct motions: a daily axial rotation, an annual rotation about the Sun, and a precessional motion of its axis.    Tides  The regular rise and fall of ocean water is called tides.Tides are water waves that occur naturally in ocean due to force of gravity on earth surface due to the moon and the sun. Please watch this video to understand the tides. Tide Formation Because of moon's gravity water bulges out of the earth surface and keep getting dragged as the moon moves around the earth. The effect of moon's gravity is more on the earth surface than the sun's gravity due to their distant positions. When sun and moon are located along the same direction high tide is higher than normal high tide and low tide is lower than normal low tide and they are collectivly called Spring Tide . When sun and moon are at right angles to each other than high tide and low tide both are shorter than usual and they are called Neep Tide . There are alawyes two high and two low tides in every 24 hours.    Some more observations  In the animation window, observe some more natural phenomena and prepare your own hypotheses. celestial sphere The yellow circle in the animation is called an Ecliptic line. It is an apparent path of the sun in the sky as viewed from the earth over the course of a year.   "

  "title": "Units and Measurements",
  "body": " Units and Measurements   Physics endeavors to decipher natural laws. In order to describe a natural law (or physical law) a measurement of varieties of physical quantities are essential. measurement Measurement is a process that uses numbers and units to describe a physical quantity based on what can be observed. A physical property which can be quantified and measured in numbers and units is called a physical quantity physical quantity. Length, mass, time, weight, temperature, density, speed, velocity, etc are physical quantities. Emotions, angers, feelings, appearances, etc which can not be quantized are not considered as physical quantities. In order to measure physical quantities some standard measures (or standards) must be defined on which everyone can agree. Standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement. We can measure things by compering them with the standards. Units of measurement provide standards for comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. A meter stick is an example of a standard. When something is measured with a meterstick, we compare their similar property with the meterstick. For example, if we measure a height of a pillar with a meterstick and found that height to be 6 meter then 6 is a number of times meterstick used in the measurement and meter is a unit (or length) of meterstick. This makes measurement easier and uniform.  There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether known as the base quantities. Their units are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. The diverse human history and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and CGS (centimeter gram second). The FPS system of units is also called British system and MKS system is also called a metric system. The metric system is a decimalized system of measurement developed in France in late century. Since the metric system is almost universally used, it is often referred to as the International System of Units and abbreviated SI. Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in table below.   The Systems of Units    Base Quantity  SI Units  SI Symbol    Mass  Kilogram  kg    Length  Meter  m    Time  Second  s    Amount of Substance  Mole  mol    Electric Current  Ampere  A    Temperature  Kelvin  K    Luminous Intensity  Candela  cd       Derived Units  Derived quantities are defined in terms of mathematical relation between the base quantities.     .

  "body": " Describing Motion     Distance: It is the length between the change in positions of an object. If is an initial position of the object and is a final position of that object then is the distance travelled by the object. It is a scalar quantity because it does not deal with the direction in which the object is travelling.It's unit is in SI system and in CGS system, and in FPS system.  Displacement: It is a direct distance between initial and final position of the object. It is the shortest path between initial and final positions of the object. It has the same unit as distance. It is a vector quantity because it has only one particular direction between the initial and position of the object. Let's understand by the example here, suppose you started travelling from initial point A and reached to point B by travelling 4 m distance along east. Now from point B you covered a distance of 3 m along north to reach to your final point C. So the direct distance between your initial position and final position is 5m given by Pythagoras theorem along north-east. . See the figure below as reference.  Displacement vector      Speed:The rate of change of position of an object is called a speed. It states that how fast the object is changing its position with respedt to time. In physics, the rate means with respect to time. It is also a scalar quantity. speed is represented by the letter, . If is an initial position and is the final position of the object then . It's unit is m\/s in SI system and cm\/s in CGS system, and ft\/s in FPS system.  Velocity: It is the speed of an object in particular direction. It is a vector quantity. It has the same units as speed. It is also represented by the letter, .  Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity is called an acceleration. It states that how fast the velocity of an object is being changed. It is also a vector quantity. If is an initial velocity and is the final velocity of the object then the acceleration of the object is given by . It's unit is in SI system. If acceleration is positive then the object is speeding up, if it is negative then the object is slowing down, if it is zero then the object is either moving with uniform velocity or remains at rest. Note: Velocity is always in the same direction as the object is moving, but the acceleration is not.    Vector quantity carries two pieces of information, i.e. magnitude and direction. Vector is often represented by an arrow. A straight line with an arrowhead where the length of the line yields information about magnitude and the arrow indicates the direction . Mathematical operation is different for vectors than in scalars. It is not just the addition or subtraction of the numbers. We are not going to perform many vector mathematical operations here rather we try to understand addition and subtraction with some simple examples. Addition or subtraction of scalar quantities are just like adding or subtracting the numbers. In vector addition, the vectors are arranged in Head to Tail to find the sum of the vectors. In vector subtraction, the vector to be subtracted is flipped in direction and added to the other vector by arranging them in “Head to Tail” to find the sum of the vectors.     For example: in , the total distance travelled by the object is However, total displacement of the object is only along north-east directin as shown by the arrow AC. . Suppose water is flowing downstream with velocity 2 in a river where you are rowing your boat with 5 downstream. You can find that you are moving with 7 velocity (or speed) downstream. If you want to go upsteam then your velocity (or speed) would be 3 only. If you want to row accross the river then your velocity would be somewhere between 3 to 7 . . Suppose Aron is sweeming in a pool of 100 m wide. He took 5 laps, so he covers total of but his displacement is just zero. Remember one lap is one complete round of trip. However, if he just take a half lap then the distance covered is the same as displacement and are 100 m .      Equations of Motion  There are three equations of motion defined by the above terminologies which can help solve problems of motion. These eqations are obtained by manipulating average velocity and acceleration of the object.     Equations of motion in horizontal direction:   .  .  .    Equations of motion in vertical direction:   .  .  .     Here,  = acceleration due to gracvity, = height attains by the object, and = time taken by the object during its motion.  In vertical direction earth plays a vitol role in the acceleration of object motion. Earth pulls every thing downwards which causes acceleration due to gravity, negative. Accleration due to gravity is the acceleration of the object caused by the earth gravitational field. The value of . In vertical motion, we consider height as positive if going up (y-axis) and height as negative if coming down. But here, we are taking if the object is going vertically up, and for the object falling down. Such conventions allow us to assume h as always positive.  Note: The above equations only work for constant acceleration or acceleration due to gravity.    Free Fall  Objects moving under the influence of only gravity is called a free fall. This means gravity causes a change in the velocity of any object by 9.80 every second. So, drop any object and let it fall toward the ground: After 1s, the speed of the object is 9.80 . After 2s, the speed of the object is 19.6 . Etc. According to Galileo the velocity of a falling object is proportional to the length of time that the object has been falling. From the first equation of motion or,  as is a constant. Hence, the object is falling with higher velocity if it is falling for a long time or from a higher position. Since is constant near the planet all objects fall at the same rate. (Assuming there is no air resistance).    Projectile Motion  In normal day life, we encounter many examples where object moves along both horizontal and verticle direction together. Such type of motion is called projectile motion and the object moving in projectile motion is called a projectile. Hence, projectile is an object which has both horizontal as well as vertical motion. The path taken by the projectile is parabolic in nature. We are not dealing with mathematical operation related to projectile motion here but we try to understand the projectile motion by the following figure.  Projectile motion    Since gravity only acts on the verticle direction the horizontal velocity remains constant always in projectile motion.   "

  "body": " Force   Force is a push or pull. It is a vector quantity. Force is anything that produces a change in the state of motion or shape of an object. Action of force on an object can change the direction of motion or change the velocity of the object. Newton ( ) is an SI unit of force. There are four fundamental forces in nature. They are   Gravitational force or Force of Gravity: The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., Foece, = weight = . Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Weight: It is the force acting on an object due to gravitational acceleration. Weight is the effect of force of gravity on an object located at a particular point. One kg of mass has a weight of about 10 N ( ).    Electromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force exists due to the charge in the object. It is also a long range force but stronger than the gravitational force. It holds all the atoms and molecules together. We discuss this force later in another chapter.    Strong nucleur force: The strong nucleur force is a short range force and it exists only inside the nucleus. It binds all the nucleons together to have atomic existance. It is the strongest force in nature.    Weak nuclear force: The weak nucleur force is also short range force and only exists inside the nucleus. It is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is responsible for radioactivity of nucleous. The improper ratio of nucleons may cause the weak nuclear force to exist.     Physical contact of the object is not necessary to experience the fundamental forces. Hoverever, there are many other forces which only act on the object if they are in contact. They are called contact forces (or mechanical forces). Frictional force, normal force, tension, drag force, applied force, etc. are some contact forces.    Contact Forces   Friction: Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., or, . Where proportionality constant is called the coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces of contact. Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence.  In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in figure . Thus, when an object is pushed to move, it must glideover these humppy, bumppy, and ditch types interlock to skip the tips of the surface. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.  Surfaces of contact as seen from microscope      In real life frictional forces are almost always present. Remember the direction of frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion or the applied force. Friction is bad as it dissipates energy but friction is also good as it allows us to roll, turn, walk, and stop. Friction between two solids does not depend on the surface area in contact. Friction can happen, even between surfaces that are not solid such as air drag. Air resistance (drag) during free fall reduces the weight of the object. Air drag (resistance) increases with the velocity of the object in free fall and when it becomes equal to the wight of the object, net force acting on the object is zero and hence the object starts falling with the constant velocity called Terminal Velocity. Skydiving is a good example of terminal velocity.   Normal: This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension: is a pulling force. It is a force acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string and acting along the directions to taut string at the point of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. The elastic property in a material has the ability to restore its shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, spring force, where k is a spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant and is stretch made on spring.    Newton's Laws of Motion  Newton recognized that there are two kinds of motion they are uniform motion and accelerated motion. Uniform motion: the movement of an object traveling in a straight line at a constant speed (no acceleration). Accelerated motion: the movement of an object traveling under the influence of some source of acceleration. On that basis he defined three laws of motion called Newton's laws of motion.  Newton's first law is the definition of a force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in uniform motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied to it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion. The first law is also called a law of inertia . Inertia is an ability of an object to resist any changes in its motion. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change the state of rest or motion of an object. Mass: It is the amount of matter in contained in an object. It is also reposible for the force of gravity of the object. Some examples of I law: 1. When the bus driver abruptly applies the breaks, passengers tend to feel a momentary pull in the forward direction. The reason behind this jerk felt by the passengers sitting inside the bus is the law of inertia. Due to inertia, our upper body part continues to maintain a state of motion even after the bus stops, thereby pushing us in the forward direction. 2. A book kept on a bookshelf does not change its shape, size, or position until acted upon by an external force. 3. A runner is not able to stop himself right after crossing the finish line. He\/She tends to take time and cover a few meters of distance running beyond the finish line. This is because the inertia of motion resists a sudden termination of motion and compels the body to maintain its state of motion.  Newton's second law is the measurement of a force which states that the acceleration of the object is directly proportional to the applied force and takes the direction of that force. Newton's II law can be expressed as . Where is the mass of the object.  Newton's third law is the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Force always comes in pair. If an object A applies the action force on the object B then object B also applies the same amount of reaction force on the object A. These forces pair always act on two different objects. If one object exerts a force on a second object, then the second object exerts an equal but oppositely directed force on the first object. Mathematically,  Some examples: 1. Earth exerts force on you because you exert an equal and opposite force on earth. Here your force is your body weight and earth reaction force is a normal force. 2. When the rifle is fired it exerts a force on the bullet and the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the rifle. 3. You are able to sweem in water because you pushes water backwardly so apply the force on water and in reaction water also applies the same force on you just in opposite direction so you can sweem nicely.     Momentum  It is the quantity of motion contained in a body. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then its momentum is . Momentum (also called linear Momentum) is a product of mass and velocity of the object. Momentum is represented by , its SI unit is . Momentum is a vector quantity and its direction is along the velocity of the object.  From Newton's II law:    Here is called impulse and is called change in momentum. They are two different physical quantities but their magnitude remains the same. A force acting on an object for a certain time changes the momentum of that object, such change in momentum is called the Impulse. Impulse is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the average force. SI unit of impulse is .   A 300 kg horse running with 40 m\/s has a momentum of     When a 430 g soccer ball is kicked, the impact lasts for 0.04 s. Find the magnitude of force that is needed to fly off the ball at 8 m\/s.          Uniform Circular Motion  In uniform circular motion an object is moving at a constant speed (not velocity) on a circular path. For an object to be in uniform circular motion, there must be a net force acting on it. This force is called a centripetal force without this force nothing can move in a circular path. This net force is not a physical force of some kind actually some other forces must be there to act like a centripetel force. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle. The centripetal force, where is mass of the object, is speed of the object, and is radius of the circluar path. Because of necessary centripetal force, sometime we feel difficulty to steer our car around a sharp curve. The sharper the curve (i.e., the smaller the radius) the greater the centripetal force required to keep the car on the curved path. Cetripetal means to look towards the center, hence centripetal force is always acting towards the center of the path. Some examples: 1. We may have noticed that when the string breaks for a whirling stone. The stone flies off along the straight line tangential to the circular path. 2. When swinging a yo-yo around in a circle. The force generated by your arm puts the yo-yo itself in motion, and the tension on the string keeps it moving in a circular path as you twirl it. If the string were to break at any given point, the yo-yo would fly off in a direction that is tangent to the point on the circle that the yo-yo was at when the string broke centripetal force .    Newton's Law of Gravitation  Newton observed that when an object falls it was accelerated toward the earth. Since the cause of such acceleration is an unbalanced force, there must be a force pulling that object toward the earth. On this basis, he came up with an idea called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It states that any two masses in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, here, is an universal gravitational constant, and are the masses of two objects, and is the distance between the them.    Gravitational force between two Objects        Escape Velocity  Escape Velocity is the minimum velocity of an object with which it can be thrown out of the planet in such a way so that it can never come back. If a stone of mass m is thrown out from the earth with an escape velocity then it never fall back on the earth again. The escape velocity of earth is 11.2 km\/s.   "

  "title": "Work, Energy, and Power",
  "body": " Work, Energy, and Power    Work: If an object is displaced along the same direction as of the applied force then work is said to be done by the force. In the figure below force is pushing a block of mass along its direction for a distance of , then work done, by this force can be calculated by Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy from one object to another. The SI unit of work is Joule . In FPS system, , and in CGS system, are the work units.   Work done by the force      A horizontal force of moves a block of mass along a horizontal direction for a distance of . How much work is done by the force?         In figure (a) force is along the direction of horizontal and the block is also displaced along the same direction from point A to point B. In this case work done by the force is given by multiplication of force and the displacement . In this figure work done by the weight and normal force is zero as these forces are perpendicular to the displacement . However, in figure (b) work done by the slanted force is not zero but can be determined by the projected force which is not in the scope of this book. Remember for work to be done, foce and displacemenet must be non-zero. Work may be positive, negative, and zero. For example: work done by applied force along the direction of displacement is positive, work done by the frictional force is negative, and work done by the force perpendicular to the displacement is zero.  Energy: The capacity of doing work by a force is called an energy. It is also a scalar quantity and has the same unit as work. There are many forms of energy, but they all fall into two categories: potential energy and kinetic energy. These energies are also called a mechanical energy. Potential energy is the energy of position of the object. It is also a stored energy on the object which is equal to the work done on the object to bring it to this position. There are several forms of potential energy, including: gravitational potential energy, chemical energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, sound energy, heat energy, light energy, geothermal energy, etc. Chemical energy: It is energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. It is the energy that holds these particles together. Foods, biomass, petroleum, and natural gas are some examples of stored chemical energy. During photosynthesis, sunlight gives plants the energy they need to build complex chemical compounds. When these compounds are later broken down, the stored chemical energy is released as heat, light, motion, and sound. Elastic energy: It is an energy stored in objects by the application of a restoring force. Compressed springs and stretched rubber bands are examples of elastic energy. Nuclear energy: It is an energy stored in the nucleus of an atom that binds the nucleus together. The energy can be released when the nuclei are combined or split apart. Nuclear power plants split the nuclei of uranium atoms in a process called fission reaction fission reaction . The sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion reaction fusion reaction . In both the fission and fusion reactions, mass is converted into energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy principle. Gravitational potential energy: or Potential energy: It is the energy of position or place. It is the work done in lifting an object against gravity near the earth's surface. Gravitational Potential energy depends only on the distance from the ground, not on the object's motion. It is given by Here is the weight of the object and distance is the height at which the object is lifted. A rock resting at the top of a hill contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. In hydropower dam, water in the reservoir stored a gravitational potential energy. Kinetic energy: It is the energy of a body due to its motion. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then kinetic energy is given by, .    Work-Energy Theorem  Let us apply Newton's II law into II equation of motion and rearange them.  Here, is final kinetic energy and is initial kinetic energy. Hence, is change in kinetic energy. Therefore, work done = change in kinetic energy. or This is known as work-energy theorem. Meaning the amount of work is done on a body is equal to its change in kinetic energy or vice a versa along the straight line.    A block of mass at rest is being pushed by an unknow force along the horizontal to bring it at 5 velocity.  How much work is done by the force?  If the body moves to a 2 m distance in this process. Find the value of unkown force.      Given: , , , .                 power  The rate of doing work is called power. It is also the rate at which the energy can be transfered. Power tell us that how fast the work has been done. Power can be expressed as  Its SI unit is Watt (w=j\/s).    Find the power a horse who does 7460 J of work in 10 second.      746 watt of power is also called 1 horsepower.       A car engine of 200kW power pushes the car to 25 m\/s. Find the thrust (force) produces by its engine.          "

  "title": "Conservation Principles",
  "body": " Conservation Principles   Conservation principles tell that some physical quantities remains constant through the change. Conservation principles began to play a central role in scientific theories from century. Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, Leibniz, and Newton established their approaches to physics on the the principle of inertia: the principle that tells a body will undergo uniform rectilinear motion unless it is disturbed. There are many conservation principles but here we are only discussing three of them.    Principle of Conservation of Energy  It states that in an isolated system, the total energy of the system is conserved. That is energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted from one form of energy to another. For example, when a stone falls from a roof its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy just before it hits the ground. When friction slows down the block to a stop, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. In case of mechanical energy, the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is conserved. That is, total energy at any moment of time is always same. Mechanical energy is due to the position and motion of the object. Therefore, In simple pendulum, when the bob is left from a displaced position it starts swinging to and fro motion due to conservation of energy. As its potential energy (PE) is converted into kinetic energy (KE) at the mean position acquire maximum velocity and keep moving otherside of mean position due to inertia. Once it reaches to another extrema it falls back again and retraces it path again and again. Click this link simple pendulum and try to understand conservation of energy principle. During the motion of a swinging pendulum, the energy is constantly changing from KE (kinetic energy) to PE (potential energy).  KE is MAX at lowest point,  KE is MIN at the top of the path ( ),  PE is MAX at top of path.      Conservation of Momentum  We have defined momentum in . Momentum, is also called a linear momentum as motion of the object is in straight line path. From Newton's II law we know that . If the force remains zero then, . This tells us that . Meaning, if total external force acting on a system is zero, then total linear momentum of the system, constant. This is known as principle of conservation of momentum. Hence, in the case of conservaiton of mementum, final momentum of the system is equal to the initial momentum of the system i.e.,  Newton's Cradle Click on the link to understand the conservation of linear momentum.    Collision  Momentum conservation is very useful in collision problems because the collision force is internal and hence does not change the total momentum. The impulse of a collision is the total momentum transferred during the collision, where a collision is an event where a very large force is exerted over a body for a very short interval of time, . During that interval magnitude of force is continuously changing. Therefore, the impulse of a force is the product of the average force and the time interval during the contact.   Collision provides a way to better understand the motion. A collision is an interaction between two objects that may or may not have made physical contact. In a collision the colliding objects experience a pair of forces acting on them. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object and these forces are equal in magnitude. These forces are Newton's III law pair. In an isolated system, total momentum is always conserved, hence such forces often increase the momentum of one object and decrease the momentum of the other. There are two kinds of collisions, elastic collision and inelastic collision. Elastic collision: objects are not deformed, e.g. bouncing balls, car's bumper, etc. Inelastic collision: objects become permanently deformed, e.g. auto accidents, throwing a mud on wall. Kinetic energy is only conserved in an elastic collission but not in an inelastic collision. However, momentum is conseved in both types of collisions. Total energy remains conserved in both types of collision.    Angular Momentum  Angular momentum is the momentum associated with a body in rotation about some axis. It is also a vector quantity. The direction of angular momentum is parallel to the axis of rotation. Spinning ball or rotating wheel has an angular momentum. Angular momentum is represented by, . Angular momentum is defined by Where is called moment of inertia and is called the rotational velocity of the object. Moment of inertia, tells us that how the mass of a body is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. Moment of Inertia, I: is an inability of a material to change its state of rotational motion. It is defined as here, is the object distance from the axis of rotation.    Torque  Just as force plays a role in moving object in linear motion, torque plays the same role in rotational an object about an axis. Torque in rotational motion is a linear analogue of force. Actually, torque is a turning effect of force which acts on a body in specific direction and at specific position. For example, if a force is applied at the center of mass of a body it will not produce any torque. But, if the same amount of force is acting off center then the body starts rotating about an axis. Just as force is a push or a pull, torque is a twist to an object around a specific axis. The magnitude of torque depends on the magnitude of applied force and the lever arm and ia given by     Conservation of Angular Momentum  Conservation of angular momentum tells that in rotaiton, initial angular momentum is always equal to final angular momentum of the body if no external torque is acting on it. That is If the moment of inertia of a rotaing body decreases then rotational velocity is going to increase. For example: 1. when ice skaters spin by pulling their arms inwards their rotational speed increase but their rotational speed decrease when they stretched their arms outwards. 2. A system of planets orbiting around a star has no net external torque acting, so its angular momentum is constant. Hence, when a planet travels along an elliptical orbit, its speed reduces when it is further away from the star and its speed increases as it approaches the star star-planet system . Look at the planetary motion of Nereid (Naptune's moon) in the law of orbits animation.   "

  "title": "Thermometers",
  "body": " Thermometers   As we know now that the most materials change their volume on heating. Such property of materials can be used to design thermometers to measure the temperature. There are varieties of thermometers in existence based on the phase (state) of materials is being used in thermometer. They are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. For example: If solid substance is used in thermometers, then the thermometers are called solid state thermometers. Platinum resistance thermometer, thermometer strip on the wall of aquarium, etc. are solid state thermometers. If liquid is used in a thermometer, then it is called a liquid thermometer. Mercury thermometer, alcohol thermometer, etc. are some examples. If gas is used then thermometer is called a gas thermometer. Hydrogen gas thermometer, hilium gas thermometer, nitrogen gas thermometer, etc. are some some examples.  Most common type of thermometer is liquid thermometer. In this thermometer, mercury or alcohol is filled in a narrow galss tube with metallic vessel at the bottom. Howerver, due to major developement in electronics, digitil thermometer is taking over the market to become more common thesedays. Here we are going to study temperature scale on the basis of liquid thermometer.  There are many types of thermometers exist in the practice, but we concentrate our study only on three basic types. They are Fahrenheit thermometer, Celsius (or Centigrade) thermometer, and Kelvin scale. Thermometers need calibration once they are made to provide correct temperature readings. To calibrate the thermometer the choice of unit and two reference points are taken. A centigrade (Celsius) thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as . In Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point (32 degree Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degree Fahrenheit) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as . Kelvin scale (usualy not called a thermometer) of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is units cooler than it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of Kelvin is equivalent to a temperature of . Traditionally, degree symbol is not assigned to the Kelvin scale. So a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin and not 300 degree Kelvin. Hence 300 Kelvin is abbreviated as . Conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below. The figure below is showing Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scale thermometers.  Thermometers    Fahrenheit     Celsius     Kelvin scale       Consider these thermometers are kept into three cups of coffey with same temperature. Where Celsius thermometer reads a temperature of C, Fahrenheit thermometer reads a temperature of F, and a Kelvin scale reads a temperature of K, then we can find their relationship as follows. Let's take one more set of unknown thermometer which has lower reference points marked as (for freezing point of water) and upper reference point marked as (for boiling point of water). When dipped into the identical cup of coffey, it reads the temeperature as . Hence we can note the temperature of coffey as . The comparision of all the thermometers reading we get the relation as  This relation is very helpful in converting one unit of temeprature into another one.    Convert into celsius temperature scale.    Here we use the following relationship      Kelvin Scale: The scale of thermometers depends upon the physical property (thermal expansion, electrical resistance, etc.) of the substance that is used in the thermometer. The physical property (e.g. thermal expansion) of materials varies differently at the different range of temperatures hence all these thermometers have a limited use. With the idea of constructing a temperature scale which should be independent on the material properties, Scottish physicist William Thomson, Baron Kelvin proposed on the basis of thermodynamics principles that the lowest possible temperature that could be achieved was , in 1848. This minimum temperature is the zero point on Kelvin scale and is known as absolute zero. Kelvin scale is a hypothetical (theoretical) thermometer scale and is also known as absolute scale. According to III law of thermodynamics, it is impossible to obtain absolute zero by any physical means. .    Quantity of Heat  Heat is a transfer of energy because of temperature difference. When an object gains or losses heat it either changes its temperature or its phase (state). A change in temperature is associated with changes in the average kinetic energy of the particles and a change in phase is associated with changes in the internal potential energy possessed by the object. In this section we will learn how to measure the quantity of heat gained or released by an object.    Specific Heat  Heat absorbing capacity of a material is known as specific heat capacity (or simply, specific heat ). It is a material property. Different materials absorb different amount of heat even for the same rise of temperature. For example, if you heat an identical iron ball and an aluminum ball in the same pot for the same time duration, then you would be surprised that the aluminum ball is colder than the iron ball. This is because the specific heat of iron is less than that of aluminum. In iron, more of the heat energy spent to increase the kinetic energy of its molecules than to increase the intermolecular potential energy. Hence, the the iron has a higher temperature. The quantity of total heat transfered to the body is given by the following formula: Where, stands for amount of heat required to change the temperature, stands for mass of the substance, stands for the specif heat capacity of the substance, and stands for the temperature change (i.e., ). Hence specific heat can be defined as the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 kg of the substance to . Its SI unit is . The greter the specific heat of the substance, the greater would be the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature per unit mass. The higher the specific heat of the substance, the higher amount of heat it can hold. The table below shows the specific heat of some common materials.   Specific heats of some common substances    Substance  Specific heat ( )    Water  1    Sand  0.16    iron  0.1    aluminum  0.22    Wood  0.42    Ice  0.5       How much heat in calorie is needed to heat 50 kg of water from to .    Given: m = 50 kg =50000 g, , , , and Q=?          Latent Heat  Heat absorbed or released by the material during phase change is called a latent heat. There is no temperature change during a phase change hence this energy is hidden from temperature scale. The energy dissipated or released during the phase change is in adjustment of particles potential energy in the bonds. Hence the amount of heat during phase change is given by Here is the amount of heat required to change the state or phase of the substance at change of state temperature, is the mass of the substance, and is the latent heat of the substance. Latent heat is also a material property. The latent (hidden) heat of fusion for water at is approximately 79.7 calories (334 J) per gram, and the latent heat of vaporization at is about 533 calories (2,230 joules) per gram. Simulation for Boiling Water     Heat Transfer  It is a process of transfer heat from one location to another due to temperature difference. Heat can only flow from high temperature to low temperature. There are three processes involved in heat transfer. They are conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction: In this process heat is transferred through a body by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated, these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so, they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying particles do not physically move from their place rather they transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time one particle knock to another it passes some of its energy to next one and returns to its original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collision and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.  Conduction Process       Convection: In this process heat transfer occurs by the actual movement of fluid particles. Convection is heat transport due to bulk fluid motion. Convection happens in gases and liquids. When a fluid is heated, its molecules which are in contact with the hot surface get hot and expand. That is the fluid above a hot surface expands, becomes less dense, and rises. It carries the thermal energy along when rises up. The relatively cold fluid on the upper surface is heavier and sink down near the heat source. Hence a current of heat cycle develops in the convection process, called convection cycle.  Radiation: It is the process in which heat transfers without the need of intervening medium. Heat transfer occurs when electromagnetic waves emitted or absorbed. The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer than those of the visible spectrum. In atomic domain, the radiation is caused because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid are accelerating electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with different efficiencies. The good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. A perfect absorber is called a black body (such perfection is not found in nature, but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. A black body absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit surface area of a perfectly black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.    Entropy  Entropy is a mathematical concept explains some usefule phenomena of thermodynamics. The change in entropy tells whether the process can take place naturally or not. A natural tendency of systems is to lose order. Entropy is a measure of that disorderness. When sugar is dissolved in water it becomes more randomized, and will not reconstitute itself in the crystalline form again by itself, unless we apply heat energy from outside to the system and evaporate all water. When a hot and a cold body are put in contact to each other, heat energy begins to flow from the hot body to the cold body until they reach at thermal equilibrium (same Temperature). Heat will never move back to the other way. To move heat from a cold body to a hot body an external work must be done by an external source such as a heat pump. Entropy is a measure of the system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for useful work. The concept of entropy provides the direction of spontaneous change for many process. It tells us that which process is allowed and which is completely prohibited even if it can not violet the fundamental law of conservation of energy. A block of ice placed on a hot pan surely melts, while the pan goes cooler. Such a process is called irreversible because no slight change will cause the melted water to turn back into ice while the pan goes hotter. In contrast, a block of ice placed in an ice water bath will either thaw a little more or freeze a little more, depending on whether a small amount of heat is added to or taken out from the system. Such a process is reversible because only an infinitesimal amount of heat is needed to change its direction from progressive freezing to progressive thawing.   "

  "title": "Fluid",
  "body": " Fluid   Fluid is a material that can flow. Gasses and liquids are fluids. To study fluid it is easier to deal with fluid's volume, density, and pressure rather than its mass and weight. For example, we do transaction of any fluids in terms of their volume (liter) not in their mass (kg). Here, some terminilogies are being introduced to study fluid and its behavior.  Density: It is defined as a mass per unit volume of the fluid. It is a scalar quantity.  Its unit is in SI system, or in cgs system, and in fps system. Any two objects of identical volume the heavier one has higher density than the other. Take two marbles of same size but one is a lead marble and another is a glass marble. Which one do you feel heavier, has the higher density.    Calculate the mass of water in a container of size 25 cm long, 15 cm wide and is filled with water up to 10 cm high. If the density of water is .    The volume of water, Hence, the mass of water in the container is given by .     Pressure: It is defined as a force per unit area of the surface. Force must be acting perpendicularly on the surface. Pressure defines how hard the object is pushing something in or out. It is a scalar quantity.  Its unit is or pascal (Pa) in SI system. In FPS system of unit it is measured in which means pounds per square inch. Many units of pressure are still in practice such as torr, bar, mm of Hg., atm., etc. 1 atm is one atmospheric preesure,     How much pressure is applied on the ground by a girl of 50 kg if she is balancing herself by standing on her one shoe heel of area .    The force exerted by the girl on ground is equal to her weight, and, Surface area = Hence, the pressure on the ground is given by .     Pressure in a Fluid  A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Consider a cylinderical water bottle of area of cross-section . If is mass of water filled in the bottle to the height , then from , we have -  Here, is the volume of fluid in a container, is the density of the fluid, and is acceleration due to gravity.    If you poke two holes in water bottle at different hights, which water-jets shoots out to larger distance from the bottle?    The pressure exerted by water at depths is given by , Since depth of water is more for the hole at the bottom, water exerts higher pressure at the bottom and hence water-jet shoots out to further distance from the bottom hole.      Archimedes' Principle  When an object is placed in a fluid it experiences an upthrust force called a buoyant force. It is arising due to changes of pressure inside fluid. This phenomenon is known as Archimedes' principle. It states that when a body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced. That is, a buoyant force ( ) = weight of displaced fluid ( ). It is the buoyant force due to which your weight feels less in sweeming pool. Actually buoyant force is the loss of weight of object in a liquid or fluid. It can also be defined as Here, is a weight of an object in air and is a weight of an object in liquid. Archimedes' principle tells whether the object floats or sinks in the fluid. If weight of the object is greater than the buoyany force, it sinks. If its weight is equal to the buoyant force, it submerges inside the fluid but does not sink. If its weight is less than the buoyant force then it floats on the surface of liquid.   Buoyant force     In this case, volume of displaced liquid is equal to the volume of submerged portion of the object. On this basis, we can tell that if the density of an object is greater than that of fluid, it sinks. If object density is equal to the density of fluid, then object submerges. If object density is less than the density of fluid, then object floats. To make iron ship not to sink in water, it is made with wide surface area and its body is like a hollow shell, so that the density of entire ship is less than the density of water.    Kinetic Theory of Gases  The nature of gas is completely different than solids and liquids. Gas tskes up the entire volume of the container and can be compressed easily. Gas pressure increase or decrease as the temperature of the container change. It diffuses (or leaks out) to air if the container is left open. On such experiences, Kinetic theory of gas is developed to explain the nature of heat and the motion of particles associated with heat energy. According to this theory, gas is composed of large number of very tiny particles called molecules. These molecules are always in random motion with all possible directions and speeds which increases with the increase of temperature. In gases, the molecules are very far away from each other than in solids and liquids and have negligibly small force of attraction between them. Hence they can move freely anywhere within the available space. This explains why a gas has no definite shape and size. To understand the more general behavior of gases kinetic theory of ideal gases is postulated as  All gases are made up of molecules. Molecules are identical, rigid, and perfectly elastic moving in random directions with all possible velocities.  The molecules are very far away from each other but they collide with each other and with walls of the container.  All the collisions are elastic, but time spent during each collision is negligibly small compared to the time spent between the collisions.  Molecules do not interact with each other (no intermolecular force of attraction) except during a collision.  The average kinetic energy of the molecules of any gas depends only on the temperature.  Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas of negligible molecular size and have no interactions among their molecules. In practice, a very dilute gas with extremely large volume of container space can be considered as an ideal gas. Remember the real gas molecules has definite size and may interact with each other. Hence this postulates are just a very simplified model to understand gas laws and need modification for real gas behaviors. To experience the general behavior of gas please play with simultion link here. gas laws     The Gas Laws  From the experience of factors affecting the gas pressure ideal gas law is defined below. Ideal Gas Law or also called equation of state. It is found that the pressure, of the gas is directly proportional to number of molecules, and the absolute temeperature, and inversely proportional to the volume, V of of the gas. That is where is proportionality constant. Therefore For mole of gas, the above equition turns into this equation is know as equation of state. Here, is number of mole of gas in a container and is universal gas constant.  If T is constant in this equation then it is called Boyle's Law  If is constant in this equation then it is called Charle's Law     "

  "title": "Charges",
  "body": " Charges   Charge is an entity which provides an electric property of the matter. Charge is of two types, positive charge and negative charge. Electrons in an atom consist of negative charge and protons of the atom consist of positve positive charge. Similar kinds of charges always repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. Charge is a scalar physical quantity. Charge is conserved meaning charge can neither be created nor be destroyed; it can only be transferred from one place to another or from one object to another. The net charge on any system is always constant. All matter is composed of atoms and atoms are composed of three elementary particles, called electrons, protons, and neutrons. Charge is also quantized meaning charge always comes in discrete amounts, and the smallest possible amount of charge that any object could have is . This is the amount of charge on one electron. Whenever an atom gains or loses an electron, atom is ionized. The ionized atom is always charged. An ion is simply an atom with a net charge. The ion can be positive or negative. If is the total negative charge on any object and is the charge of electron, then total number of electron, n on that object can be find using the following equation. where     A glass rod is rubbed vigorosly with a fur and found that it gained of charge. Calculate how many electrons has the glass rod lost?        electrons.        Coulomb's Law  The force of attraction or repulsion between any two point charges is directly proportional to the product of these charges and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them. The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on the charges and , and is a distance between the two charges (see figure below) then from Coulumb's law Here, Coulomb's constant, . This law only works for two point charges at rest. Hence, the Coulomb's law is also known as law of electrostatic force on   Coulomb's force    unlike charges     like charges        If the distance between an electron and a proton in a hydrogen atom is . Find the electrostatic force acting btween the electron and the proton.        . Negative sign explains that the force is attractive in nature.        Electric Field  The space around a charge where force of attraction or repulsion can be experienced by any other charged particle is called an electric field. Electric field is also known as electrostatic field intensity. It is an inherent property of a charge. An electric field is produced by a charge and is experienced by another charge. It is an electric field of a charge which tells another charge how to move in the space if it is free to do so. Electric field is a force acting on a unit charge and is a vector quantity. Electric field lines: It is an imaginary path of a unit positive charge in an electric field. Electric field lines are aslo known as electric lines of force. It is always pointed radially outward for a positve charge and radially inward for a negative charge as shown in figure .   Electric Lines of Force    due to a +ve charge     due to a -ve charge     due to two unlike charges     due to two like +ve charges        Materials on Electrical Point of View  On the basis of electrical behavior there are four types of materials exist in nature they are conductor, insulator, semiconductors, and superconductors.   Conductor: It is a material where charge carriers (electrons or ions) are free to move within it. Copper, aluminum, gold, mercury, iron, water-salt solution, etc. are few examples of conductors. In a conductor outermost electrons of an atom are loosely bounded with its nucleus and hence are free to move throughout the material even at very low temperature. The random motion of electrons causes zero net electric current in a conductor unless an external electric field is applied on it. Insulator: It is a material where electrons are tightly bounded with their atom and can not move very easily. Plastics, glass, rubber, wood, porcelain, etc. are few examples of insulators. Check the simulation link conductor & insulator  Semiconductor: It is a material having properties between insulator and conductor. Silicon and germanium are good example of it. At low temperature this material behaves as an insulator and at high temperature it behaves as a conductor. The conductivity of semiconductor can be increased enormously by doping of this material with a very small amount of suitable dopants such as boron, phosphorous, or arsenic. Superconductor: It is a material which transfers electrons from one atom to another throughout the material without any resistance. No loss of energy can be observed when material conduct electricity. Mercury shows superconducting nature at temperature below 4 Kelvin.   "

  "title": "Electricity",
  "body": " Electricity   It is a branch of physics which deals with the motion of charges in a conductor. When charge flows from one place to another, an electrical current is formed. An electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge. If a net charge passes through any conductor in time , then the electric current is given by Its unit is Ampere (A). One ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity and its conventional direction is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In conductor, current flows solely due to motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electrons flow. From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, the current is said to be direct current, or DC current. It is commonly used in devices electronic devices like cell phones and computers. If the direction of motion of charges reverses periodically, the current is known as an alternating current, or AC current. It is commonly used in the electrical power systems that supply to homes and commercial applications. AC current goes from positive to negative in a cycle, while DC current is always in the same direction. Current can only exist between two points of different potential (voltage) connected by a conductor and can only exist whenever a conductive path with no breaks is provided. DC & AC Flow of charges in DC current is similar to flowing water, but in AC current, charges do not go any where rather they are oscillating about the mean position at their respective position. Check the simulation link to visualize DC and AC current. DC & AC AC is more efficient to transmit over long distances than DC. This is the reason why AC is used in power transmission and distribution as well as in motors and other equipment. It is also used in many household appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. AC can also be easily transformed to different voltages using a transformer, while this is not easy to achieve with DC. DC voltage can be stored in a device called battery, while AC voltage can not be stored.    Electric Potential (Voltage)  Electric potential, also known as voltage, is a measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge in an electric field. That is, or, . It is the amount of work required to move a unit positive charge from one point to another in an electric field. The unit of electric potential is the volt (V). A higher electric potential difference between two points indicates a greater amount of energy required to move a unit charge between those points. Voltage can be think of like a \"push\" for a charge. The higher the voltage, the more \"push\" the charge experience to flow through wires. Charge can only flow from high potential(voltage) to low potential (voltage). It's important to note that just like water can be dangerous if not handled properly, electricity can also be dangerous if not handled with care.    Ohm's Law  Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the two ends of the conductor, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. It can be mathematically expressed as or, here I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance of the conductor. Resistance: is a restriction imposed by a conductor on the motion of a current. Motion of charge carriers (electrons) are not very smooth in a conductor as they bump onto the other electrons and positive charge residual atoms during their motion. Such restrictions in flow of electrons is measured as a resistance of a conductor in current flow. It is denoted by and its unit is Ohms ( ). Electrical Power: It is the measure of energy transferred or consumed per unit time i.e.,   Hence power is also defined as the product of current and voltage. Its unit is Watts (W). One watt means consuming the one joule of energy every second.  Now from Ohm's law,  Hence, the power of electrical circuit is given as     Electrical Shock: According to Ohm's law if resistance of the conductor is low then the higher current can flow through it. High current can be deadly. Actually, a “voltage” does not go “into” your body rather current can pass through it when charges flow toward a lower potential. In order to get electric shock atleast of current must pass through our body. In dry condition, human body has a resistance of about , so to have current flowing through our body we need to touch the voltage source of about , as shown in the calculation below. In wet condition, human body resistance becomes only , so to get current through our body we need to touch the voltage source of about .    Electrical Circuits  Electrical circuit is a network of electrical elements (such as resistance (bulb), battery, conductor, switch, etc.) through which current can flow in a closed path. Electrical circuits can be of two types,  Series Circuit: in this type of circuits all the electrical components are connected one after another in such a way that the same current flows through each components as shown in figuer below. An example of a series circuit is a string of Christmas lights, where each bulb is connected to the next in a line. If one bulb burns out, the entire circuit is broken and none of the lights will turn on.  Series circuit      Parallel Circuit: in this type of circuits all the electrical components are connected side by side in such a way that the voltage across each component is the same as shown in figuer below. An example of a parallel circuit is a house's electrical system, where different appliances are connected to the same circuit but have their own separate paths for current to flow through. If one path is broken or one appliance stops working, it doesn't affect the other appliances or the overall circuit.  Parallel circuit       series & parallel circuit To change from series to parallel circuit, Please hold the bulb and rotate the circuit in the simulation.   "

  "title": "Magnetism",
  "body": " Magnetism   It is a branch of physics which deals with magnets and magnetic properties of materials. It defines the magnetic behavior of material which is associated with the motion of electric charge. The motion of charges in a conductor or in space gives rise to magnetic fields and magnetism is a result of magnetic fields. The word ”magnet” is taken from Latin word  meaning stones from magnesia. ”Magnetis [líthos]” is sources of lodestones found in Manisa, Turkey. Magnetism is caused by moving charges and is experienced by moving charges. It is a phenomenon of materials by which they attract or repel other materials. The motion of an electron in an orbit around a nucleus or its spin on an axis produces a magnetic field.  The most familiar magnet is a bar magnet. It is a piece of iron bar that has been magnetized. However, other shape of magnets are also available these days such as disk magnet, horseshoe magnet, ring magnet, etc.  Magnets of different shapes    In any magnet, there are two regions (normally at the ends or faces) where magnetic strength is very strong. These stronger regions are called magnetic poles. One is designted as north pole, N and the other as south pole, S . This is because When a magnet is hanged by a thread and allowed to rotate freely, it will align itself in a north-south direction, due to the earth's magnetic field. The north end of the magnet will point towards the Earth's geographic north pole and the south end towards the Earth's geographic south pole. This is why north pole is also known as north seeking pole and the south pole as south seeking pole . The magnet also aligns at an angle itself with the earth's horizontal plane. This angle is known as the angle of dip or inclination , it varies depending on the location on the earth surface. The magnet also aligns itseld at an angle from the true north-south direction. This angle is known as magnetic declinaiton . The magnetic declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north direction. Magnetic north is the direction indicated by a compass, and true north is the direction of the Earth's geographic north pole. This angle can vary depending on location and time. earth as a magnet   Like poles of magnet repel and unlike poles attract. North and south poles always exist in pairs (there are no magnetic monopoles in nature), so if one were to split a permanent magnet in half, two smaller magnets would be created, each with a north pole and south pole. Even if one cuts a magnet into pieces all the way down to a single atom they still get a N pole and a S pole because of orbiting electron in the atom. Just like a graviational force both electric and magnetic forces can act on the objects without being in direct contact.  Magnet        Electromagnetism  Orsted discovered that electric currents can produce magnetic fields and Faraday discovered that magnetic fields can be used to induce electric currents in a circuit. A moving electrical charge also generates a magnetic field just as changing magnetic field induces current in a conductor. In fact, a traditional magnet is the result of individual motion of electrons within the atoms of the magnet. These atoms are so aligned that magnetic field procduced by their electrons are pointed along a uniform direction giving rise to a mangetic field of the magnet. In non-magnetic materials, the electrons move in such a way that the individual magnetic fields point in different directions, so they cancel each other out and the net magnetic field generated is negligible. In normal condition, magnetic fields of the magnetic material are distributed in groups of small region, called domain and magnetic fields of each domain are oriented in different directions to cancel each other effect. This is why iron is just a piece of metal bar unless it is magnetized.  Electromagnetism is considered as the interaction of electric and magnetic effects. It tells that  the moving charges (current) give rise to magnetic fields, current produce magnetic field  and changing magnetic field gives rise to electric current magnetic field generating current  . The direction of the magnetic field produced by a current in wire can be determinded using right hand thumb rule . If fingers of right hand is curl along the direction of current moving then thumb is pointed along the direction of magnetic field produced by the current. In contrary, if thumb is pointed along the direction of current then curled fingers show the direction of magnetic field generated around the wire.  Right Hand Thumb Rule        Electromagnet  An electromagnet typically consists of a coil of wire, often wrapped around a ferromagnetic core, such as iron. When an electric current is passed through the coil, it creates a magnetic field around the core. This magnetic field can be used to attract or repel ferromagnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the coil. Electromagnets are used in a wide range of applications, including electric motors, generators, and audio speakers. They can also be used to create temporary or adjustable magnetic fields, making them useful in scientific and industrial settings. electromagnet     Transformer  Transformer is an electrical appliance which convert large current at low voltage to low current at high voltage, and vice versa. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to transform electrical energy from one circuit to another one. An AC current is needed to operate transformer. In AC current direction of current is keep changing which changes the magnetic field generated in the primary coil of transformer. Such changing magnetic field induces the current in the secondary coil of transformer. A typical transformer consists of a two or more coils of insulated wire wound on a laminated iron core. An alternating (AC) voltage which is to be reduced or increased is connected to the coil, called the primary coil or input coil. This coil magnetizes the iron core. A voltage is then induced in the other coil, called the secondary or output coil. The change of voltage (or voltage ratio) between the primary and secondary depends on the turns ratio of their two coils. Transformer    Schematic of Transformer    There are two types of transformer on the basis of their operation. If the number of turns in primary coil is less than that at secondary then it is called a step-up transformer and if number of turns in primary is grater than that in secondary then it is called a step-down transformer. Transformer transfers an electrical power from primary coil to secondary coil hence it also obeys the principle of conservation of energy. That is,  see equation for electrical power.   "

  "title": "Wave and its Properties",
  "body": " Wave and its Properties   When a stone is thrown in a quiet pond a number of nice circular rings, called ripples emerge on the surface of water which grow gently and move across the pond in a concentric pattern. These growing ripples are called a wave which carries energy from the point of stone thrown to the edge of a pond. Hence a wave can be defined as a disturbance in space that can carry energy from one location to another. A wave creates in a medium when a medium is trying to regain its equilibrium state (normal position). When a stone is thrown it transfers its energy to the surface of water due to which water layer stretches downwards till stone dips down that layer of water. When stone leaves the water layer, water wants to recover its original position to maintain equilibrium due to surface tension but as it reaches to the original position it keeps raising upward because of inertia and stretches the water surface again till it reaches the maximum height. Now due to surface tension this layer of water gets pulled down again and starts falling down below the equilibrium position due to inertia such procedure is the cause of waves (disturbances) on water. Energy propagates two ways in water one way is due to vertical up and down motion of water surface and another way is a back and forth motion of water molecules inside the water. Similar to concentric circles on water surface energy transmitted in space in the form of concentric spheres. Figure below ripples in wave shows the same disturbances traveling away from the center as a series of successive wavefronts labeled crests and troughs. A wavefront is a locus of points along which all phases and displacements are identical. The solid circles depict the outward-moving wave crests; the dashed circles represent wave troughs. Adjacent crests are always a wavelength apart, as are the adjacent troughs.  Waves     Ripples on Water Surface     Schematics of ripples       In short, wave is a wiggles in time and space. On the basis of particle motion relative to the direction of energy propagation there are two forms of waves.  Longitudinal wave, and  Transverse wave.  In longitudinal wave the medium particles vibrate parallel to the motion of the energy. Longitudinal waves are also called pressure waves. As a layer of one part of a medium creates pressure on the other part of the medium. Sound waves in any medium, waves propagating along spring are an example of such wave. In transverse wave the medium particles vibrate perpendicular to the motion of the energy propagation. Movement of a wave through a solid object like a stretched rope or a trampoline is an example of such wave.  On the basis of requirements of medium to propagate energy there are two types of waves.  Mechanical wave, and  Electromagnetic wave.  Mechanical waves require material medium to propagate such as sound waves, water waves, string waves, seismic waves, etc. Electromagnetic waves on the other hand do not need any medium but can propagate both in vacuum and in a medium, such as light waves, heat waves, radio waves, etc. Electromagnetic (em) waves are transverse in nature where electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of energy propagatation. Longitudinal waves occur when a spring is fixed at one end and pulled back and forth by the other end as shown in figure below. Transverse waves occur when a spring or string is fixed at one end and wiggled up and down by the other end as shown in figure below. Both the waves can be easily described by a transverse nature as they are periodic in nature. The crest is the highest point on a wave. The trough is the valley between two waves, is the lowest point. The wavelength, is the distance, either between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. It is the length of one complete wave. The amplitude, is the peak value (either positive or negative) of a wave. The distance from the undisturbed level (equilibrium position) to the trough or crest. The compression is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are crowded together. The rarefaction is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are spread apart. The wavelength is the distance from compression to compression or rarefaction to rarefaction in a pressure (longitudinal) wave. The frequency, is a number of complete waves per second.  Representation of waves    Longitudinal wave     Transverse wave     If is a time period to generate one complete wave then . Its unit is Hertz (Hz), i.e. cycles per second.  Wave speed, is telling how fast the information propogates. Suppose wave covers (information reaches) a distance in time , then from equation , we have Therefore, using equation    There is a third kind of new wave that has just been discovered, known as a gravitaional wave. It is a disturbance in spacetime and can pass through anything undisturbed. It travels with the velocity of light. It stretches and squashes the spacetime during propagation.   Resonance: It is a condition at which amplitude of vibration of an object becomes maximum once the object is subjected to a force with a frequency equal to its natural frequency. Resonance is a frequency at which standing waves are produced. The natural frequencies of a musical instrument are reffered as the harmonics of the instrument.    Sound  Sound is a longitudinal wave that can be produced by vibration. The speed at which sound waves travel through a medium depends on the density and stiffness of the medium, whether condition, temperature, moisture, etc. It is a mechanical wave and creates pressure on a layer of medium when propagates, hence it is also called a pressure wave. Sound wave is longitudinal in nature. When such energy reaches to our eardrum it begins vibrating and we get sensation of hearing. The physical character of sound depends upon the listener's audible perception. The physical quantity that defines the loudness is amplitude (sound pressure) of the wave and the quantity that defines the timbre (or quality) of sound is a frequency . A sound of frequency to is audible to healthy human ear. Loudness increases with the increase of pressure amplitude at a given frequency. Loudness (or Intensity level) is a sound energy received by a unit area of listener's eardrum (or detector) in unit time. Loudness is a listener's perception. Intensity is an energy carried by a wave per unit area per unit time. Intensity is a property of sound producing device. Loudness is an intensity received by a listener.  More content.    Reverberation and Echo  Echo and reverberation are two distinct phenomenon of sound waves which occur due to its reflection from any surfaces. Sound endures in our brain for longer than 0.1 second. If sound is reflected from any surface reaches to our ear within 0.1 second of the initial sound, then it seems that the sound is prolonged. The reception of reflected sound within 0.1 second causes the reverberation(or) the prolonging of a sound effect. The speed of sound in air is about at room temperature. If the wall of a room is meter away from the source of sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s Hence, causing a prolonged sound effect, called a reverberation . Echoes are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original sound was heard, then echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the original sound wave as in reverberation.    Doppler Effect  The Doppler effect is the change in perceived frequency of a source due to the relative motion between the source and the receiver. It applies to all sorts of waves. Doppler effect can be experienced as the change in pitch (or frequency) received. When the ambulence is approaching, the pitch of siren is getting higher than the actual frequency of siren. When the ambulence passes by, the frequency sounds the same as the actual emitted frequency and when the ambulance is moving away, the pitch is getting lower than the actual emitted frequency. When the source of the waves is coming towards the observer, observer receives more waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves bunch together for the observer giving impression for the decrease of wavelength and causing an increase in the frequency. Conversely, if the source of waves is going away from the observer, observer receives less waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves ”spread out” for the observer giving impression for the increase of wavelength and causing a decrease in the frequency. Doppler effect    "

  "title": "Light",
  "body": " Light   Light is a form of energy. It excites the sensation of vision when strikes the eye retina. To see things around having only eye is not very important but also the presence of light is very important. A blind person can not see anything even if the room is full of light just as a normal person can not see anything if room is completely dark. Light coming from an object when falls on the surface of eye retina we can see that object. Even though light helps us see things around light itself is invisible. However, we divide light into two categories, the visible light and the invisible light. It is not because we can or can not see the light rather it is based on the sensation of vision produced by these light in our eye. Light which can help sensation of vision is called a visible light and that which can not stimulate the sensation of vision is called an invisble light. Light is an electromagnetic radiation which consists of the ranges of waves from gamma rays to radio waves. The so called visible light is a very small portion of an electromagnetic radiation.  Electromagnetic Spectrum NASA       Geometrical Optics  Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called a luminous (or self-luminous) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb, fireflies, etc. Objects that do not emit but reflect light are known as non-luminous objects such as moon, planets, wood, plastics, metals, etc.  Light travels in straight lines until it encounters with some obstacle. Hence we can approximate light by considering it as a ray. The physics which deals with light in the form of a ray is called geometrical optics. Light bents from its straight path when it strikes on the surface of another medium such as in reflection and refraction. When light strikes on the surface of material three phenomena happen. That is,  light reflects from the material  light transmitts throgh the material, and  light is absorbed by the the material.      Reflection of Light  When light travels in one medium strikes onto the surface of another medium it bounces off to the same medium is known as reflection. It is the reflection which helps us to see our image in the mirror. There are two types of reflection, specular (regular) reflection and diffuse (irregular) reflection. Both types of reflection obey the laws of reflection. Reflection of Light    Laws of Reflection:    The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the point of incident all lie in the same plane.    The second law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.   Consider a light ray, AO is incident on a smooth surface, like morror at an angle and bounces off, then from law of reflection      Reflection of light     Regular reflection     Irregular reflection         Refraction of Light  The phenomenon of bending of light ray as it goes from one medium to another is called a refraction. The velocity of light depends on the medium it is propagating which causes the refraction. The measure of an obstacle that a medium impose on the velocity of light is known as refractive index of that medium. Refraction of Light      Refraction of light     Bent Pencil         Dispersion of Light  The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent colors is known as dispersion. When white light passes through a prism it splitted into seven colors due to dispersion of light. The images of this color patterns formed on a screen is called a spectrum. The spectrum consists of a visible and invisible regions of light. The principal colors of light in the visible spectrum are given as \"VIBGYOR\" (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red). The deviation occurred in violet light is maximum and that for red light is minimum as shown in figure . In the invisible regions, the spectrum of wavelengths shorter than violet is called an ultraviolet light and that for longer than red is called an infrared light. The color of light is dependent on its wavelength, . Here is a list of wavelengths of visible light   Dispersion of light     Rainbow is formed when sunlight is dispersed by rain droplets which are suspended in air. When sunlight enters the raindrop it refracts then it undergoes dispersion and total internal reflection from the rear end of the droplet surface and again refracted out in the atmosphere and that's how we see a rainbow. So all the given process i.e total internal reflection, refraction, and dispersion take place in the rainbow formation as shown in figure . Scattering of light doesn't take place in the process of formation of a rainbow.  Dispersion of light      Scattering of Light  It is a phenomenon of redirected light in different directions when it interacts with small particles or irregular surfaces. This can cause the light to appear hazy or dispersed. Due to scattering sky looks bluish as blue colors scattered more in sky than any other colors from the visible spectrum of light. In fact, violet light scattered more than blue but our eyes are more sensitive o blue color than violet light hence blue colors are much more prevailed than others in sky. At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel longer distance in the atmosphere which causes most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths to scatter in the sky and only red color can reach to our eyes hence the sun appears reddish in color.

  "title": "Atomic Structure",
  "body": " Atomic Structure    Dalton's atomic model was proposed in 1803. It tells that  All matter is composed of atoms, which are indivisible and indestructible.  Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties.  Atoms of different elements have different properties and masses.  Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds.  In chemical reactions, atoms are rearranged to form new compounds, but no atoms are created or destroyed. Dalton's atomic theory laid the foundation for modern atomic theory.   Thomson's atomic model was proposed in 1904. It was based on his discovery of the electron, a negatively charged particle within the atom. According to Thomson's model, the atom was a sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded within it like raisins in a pudding. Hence this model is also known as \"plum pudding\" model. This model was later modified by Rutherford's atomic model.   Rutherford's atomic model , also known as the \"planetary\" model, was proposed in 1911 based on his gold foil experiment. The experiment involved firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observing their deflection patterns using a screen. The results showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, but a small percentage were deflected at large angles, suggesting the presence of a heavy and dense nucleus at the center of the atom. Rutherford's atomic model proposed that an atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its center surrounded by electrons in orbits around the nucleus. The electrons were held in their orbits by the attractive force between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons. This model explained why most alpha particles passed straight through the foil and why a small percentage were deflected at large angles. It also helped to establish the concept of the atomic nucleus and the basic structure of the atom. Gold's Foil Experiment    Atomic Model    Dalton's Model     Thomson's Model     Rutherford's Model        Blackbody Radiation  In the successive evolution of atomic model, we needed to understant light very well. From the late 19th century, scientists realized that visible light of all frequencies was emitted by the atoms of glowing hot solid, such as the filament of light bulb. The study of blackbody radiation helps understand the nature of heat and light. Blackbody radiation is a cornerstone in the study of quantum mechanics.This experiment led to the discovery of Quantum mechanics which gives a complete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at the sub-atomic level. Blackbody radiation is the theoretical description of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect blackbody, which is an object that absorbs all radiation falling on it and reflects none. In 1900, Max Planck proposed a theoretical model to explain the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation, which was in agreement with experimental observations. Planck's model proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets, called quanta, rather than continuously. This was a major departure from classical physics and marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. Planck's work laid the foundation for the understanding of the nature of light and electromagnetic radiation and has had a profound impact on modern physics. The study of blackbody radiation continues to be an important area of research in physics.   Blackbody Radiation    The blackbody radiation plot shows the spectral distribution of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody as a function of wavelength or frequency. The plot is typically represented as a curve that shows the intensity of the radiation emitted at each wavelength or frequency. The shape of the blackbody radiation curve depends on the temperature of the blackbody. At low temperatures, the curve peaks at longer wavelengths in the infrared region. As the temperature increases, the peak of the curve moves towards shorter wavelengths, and at high temperatures, the peak is in the ultraviolet region. The blackbody radiation plot is an important tool for understanding the nature of heat and light. shows how the brightness of the light varies with wavelength emitted by the objects at four different temperatures. It has been observed that all objects radiate electromagnetic radiation and the strongest wavelength depends on its temperature. The higher the temperature of the body, the shorter the brightest wavelength (or, the higher the frequency). For example, a hot iron bar that glows yellow is hotter than one that glows red. For an object at room temperature, most of the radiation emits in infrared region and hence is invisible.  Planck explained the spectrum of radiation by assuming that hot objects emitt or absorbed energy in discrete packets, called quanta . Quanta is the plural form of quantum (in Latin, quantum means how much). The higher the frequency of the light, the more the energy per quantum. That is, the energy emited in radiation is given by Here is quantum of energy, is planck's constant, , m\/s is a velocity of light, is a wavelength of light, and is frequency of light.    Find the energy of a photon emitted from a red light of frequency .    From equation , we have       Photoelectric Effect  The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light of a certain frequency shines on it. The effect is a result of the transfer of energy from photons in the light to electrons in the metal, causing the electrons to be ejected. The photoelectric effect demonstrated that light has a dual nature, both as a wave and as a particle, and helped lead to the development of quantum mechanics.  The photoelectric effect was first observed by Hertz in the late 19th century and later explained by Einstein in 1905. The basic idea behind the photoelectric effect is that light is composed of individual particles, called photons, that carry a specific amount of energy. When these photons hit a metal surface, they transfer their energy to the electrons in the metal. If the energy of the photon is high enough, it can cause an electron to be ejected from the metal and become a free electron. This process only occurs with light of a certain frequency, known as the threshold frequency. If the frequency of the light is below this threshold, no electrons will be emitted, no matter how intense the light is. If the frequency is above the threshold, the number of electrons emitted will increase with the intensity of the light. The photoelectric effect challenged the classical understanding of light as a wave, and led to the development of quantum mechanics, which views light and matter as having both wave-like and particle-like properties. The photoelectric effect is widely used in modern technology, such as photodiodes, photovoltaics, and photoelectric sensors, etc. Photoelectric Effect Simulation.   Einstein's formula for photoelectric effect is given by where is energy of a photon of light whose frequency is  is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, and is work function of the metal (i.e., energy needed to pull the electron from the metal). Eventhough, photon is massless and always moves with the speed of light, it behaves like a particle and possesses energy and momentum. It also interacts with other particles in the same way as one particle interacts with others.    The ultraviolet light of frequency is incident on the surface of a metal, whose work function is . Show that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is .    Given: , , .  From equation        The Dual Nature of Light  The dual nature of light refers that light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behavior, which was first described by the wave-particle duality theory in quantum mechanics. This theory states that light can behave as both a wave and a particle depending on the experimental setup used to observe it. For example, in the double-slit experiment, light behaves as a wave, but in the photoelectric effect, it behaves as particles, called photons. The dual nature of light is still not fully understood and remains one of the most intriguing concepts in physics. In the double-slit experiment, light passing through two slits interferes with itself, creating a characteristic pattern on a screen behind the slits, which is typical of wave behavior. However, when light is emitted from a source and detected one photon at a time, the photons are found to behave as particles and follow a random path through the slits, not forming any interference pattern. Dual nature of light     Bohr's Model of Hydrogen Atom  The Bohr model of the atom is a simplified representation of the structure of an atom proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. According to the Bohr model, an atom consists of a central nucleus composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons surrounded by electrons in shells or orbits. The electrons occupy discrete energy levels and move in circular orbits around the nucleus, and the energy of an electron depends on its distance from the nucleus. The quantized orbits correspond to specific energy levels, and the transition of an electron from one energy level to another results in the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation, which is observed as a spectral line. The Bohr model helps explain the emission and absorption spectra of atoms and laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics. The Bohr model is used to describe the structure of hydrogen energy levels. The represents shell structure, where each shell is associated with principal quantum number . The amount of energy in each level is reported in eV, and the maxiumum energy is the ionization energy of 13.6 eV. The movement of electrons between these energy levels produces a spectrum.   Energy level diagram of hydrogen atom    Hydrogen Atom     Spectral Lines      The allowed value of the atomic radius is given by Where, is a positive integer, is the smallest allowed radius for the hydrogen atom also known as the Bohr's radius, . Bohr calculated the energy of an electron in the level of hydrogen atom by using the formula given below   In the numbers on the left side represent energy levels with the lowest energy level at the bottom and on right side representing their corresponding values. The arrows represent all possible transitions of electron from one energy level to another. Each group of transitions is given the name of the scientist who identified their origin. Longer arrow means more energy is released during transition and hence the light of shorter wavelength is being emitted. The Balmer series releases light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Lyman series, with longer arrows, requires the higher energy of the UV region. The Paschen, Brackett series, and Pfund series with shorter arrows require the lower energy of the IR region. According to Bohr model, Lyman series appears when electrons jump from higher energy levels to energy state. Balmer series appears when electrons jump from higher energy levels to energy state, and so on.    Origin of Spectra  The term \"spectrum\" originated from the Latin word \"spectrum\" which means \"appearance\". The idea of a spectrum in physics and optics refers to the distribution of light into its component colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) when passed through a prism or diffraction grating. Spectral lines are caused by the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with atoms or molecules. When an atom or molecule is excited by absorbing a photon of light, its electrons can transition to higher energy levels. When the electrons eventually fall back down to their ground state, they emit photons of light at specific, characteristic wavelengths, which correspond to the difference in energy between the two states. This results in the emission of light at specific wavelengths, known as spectral lines. The position and intensity of these lines are unique to the elements or compounds present, and can be used to identify and analyze the composition of stars, planets, and other celestial objects. The is the visible emission spectrum of H, He, and N line spectra, and their absorption spectra.   Types of light spectra      X-Rays  X-rays are electromagnetic radiations with high energy and short wavelength. Its wavelength range from 0.01 to 10 nm. This short wavelength allows X-rays to penetrate materials, making them useful for medical imaging and other applications.They are used to produce images of bones and other internal organs, as well as for industrial and scientific applications. X-rays are also used in radiation therapy to treat cancer and other medical conditions. However, exposure to X-rays can be harmful, so it is important to use protective measures and limit unnecessary exposure. The discovery of X-rays is credited to German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895. Röntgen was studying cathode rays in a vacuum tube when he noticed that a screen coated with a fluorescent material emitted a bright glow when exposed to the rays. X-rays are just the reverse of photoelectric effect. Roentgen discovered that holding a high voltage across two electrodes could result in the production of high energy photons, which he called \"X-rays\" because their nature was unknown at the time.   X-ray production    X-rays are produced by the sudden change in large kinetic energy when electrons smash into the target electrode in a cathode ray tube . The energy of the x-rays produced depends on the voltage applied.    The Laser  The acronym LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The light emitted from a laser is distinctly monochromatic compared to the light emiited from lightbulb or the sun. It is spatially and temporally coherent to a much higher degree than other light sources. Hence, the laser is a concentrated beam of light through the process of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. Lasers have a wide range of applications in fields such as medicine, communications, manufacturing, and entertainment. They work by emitting a narrow, intense beam of light that can be precisely controlled and directed, making them useful for tasks that require high precision or intense light. Here are some important processes that make laser a very important tool. Light emission: Lasers emit light at a specific wavelength, which is determined by the laser material used. This narrow spectral width makes the light highly collimated and monochromatic, meaning it has a single wavelength and travels in a straight path. Stimulated emission: Lasers rely on the process of stimulated emission to produce light. This involves the absorption of energy by a material, followed by the release of that energy in the form of a photon. The photon then triggers the emission of additional photons, creating a chain reaction that results in the intense beam of light. Active medium: The active medium is the material that produces the laser light. It can be a solid, liquid, or gas, and it is chosen based on the desired wavelength and type of laser. Pumping: The active medium must be excited, or “pumped,” to generate the laser light. This can be done through electrical means, or by shining a light on the medium. Reflective cavity: The laser light is contained within a reflective cavity, which is formed by two mirrors facing each other. The light bounces back and forth between the mirrors, amplifying and intensifying the beam as it passes through the active medium. Output coupler: One of the mirrors is partially transparent, allowing some of the laser light to escape and form the laser beam. Population inversion: is a key concept in laser physics and refers to the state of a group of atoms in the active medium of a laser. Normally, the majority of atoms in a material are in the lowest energy state (ground state), and a small fraction are in excited states. In a population inversion, the situation is reversed, with the majority of atoms being in excited states and a small fraction in the ground state. This condition is necessary for a laser to produce light, as it provides the necessary amount of excited atoms that can undergo stimulated emission, releasing photons that amplify and produce the laser beam. The pumping process is responsible for creating the population inversion in the active medium. In summary, population inversion is the requirement for laser light generation, as it provides the necessary population of excited atoms to produce the beam of light through stimulated emission.

  "body": " Nuclear Structure   The nucleus is the central and most important part of an atom. It is composed of protons and neutrons collectively known as known as nucleons , and is located in the center of the atom. The protons in the nucleus are positively charged and the neutrons are neutral in charge. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number and the atomic element of the atom. The nucleons are held together by the strong nuclear force. Strong nuclear force is a very short-range attractive force that acts between nucleons and helps keep the nucleus from flying apart due to the repulsive force of the positively charged protons. The number of neutrons in a nucleus can vary for the same element, leading to the existence of isotopes . Isotopes are atomic species of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. This means that isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but a different atomic mass. Due to the difference in the number of neutrons, isotopes of an element can have different physical and chemical properties. Some isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, while others are radioactive and decay over time. Isotopes are important in many fields, including medicine, industry, and scientific research. For example, in medicine, certain radioactive isotopes are used to diagnose and treat diseases, while in industry, stable isotopes are used as tracers to study the behavior of materials. In scientific research, isotopes are used to study the age of rocks and fossils, and to determine the origin and evolution of the universe. Here is the isotopic natation of the nucleus. where = chemical symbol of element, = atomic number of element, and = mass number of nucleus = number of protons and neutrons in nucleus. Therefore the number of neutron, .  There are over 3,000 known isotopes in the periodic table, but not all of them are naturally occurring. Some isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, while others are radioactive and decay over time. The number of isotopes of an element can vary greatly, with some elements having only one or two isotopes, while others have many. The lightest element hydrogen has three isotopes . They are Hydrogen: , Deuterium: , and Tritium: . Heavy water is a type of water molecule that contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (H-2) instead of the common hydrogen isotope (H-1). Heavy water has the same chemical properties as regular water , but its physical properties, such as boiling and melting points, are slightly different. Heavy water is used in various industrial and scientific applications, including nuclear reactors, where it serves as a moderator to slow down the speed of neutrons in the reactor core.   The isotopes of hydrogen     Carbon is an element that has several isotopes. Some of them are carbon-12 (or, ) and carbon-13 (or, ), and carbon-14 (or, ). Carbon-12 and carbon-13, are naturally occurring isotopes and make up the majority of carbon on Earth. Carbon-12, has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and is the most abundant in nature. Carbon-12 is considered the standard for atomic mass. Carbon-13, has 6 protons and 7 neutrons and is a stable isotope. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total carbon on Earth. Carbon-14 is a naturally occurring isotope that is produced in the Earth's atmosphere through cosmic radiation and is taken up by living organisms. It is used in the radiocarbon dating method to determine the age of organic materials and is an important tool in archaeology and other fields.    Radioactivity  Radioactivity is the process of spontaneous decay (disintegrating) of an atomic nucleus. In this process, a nucleus of a radioactive isotope breaks apart into smaller and more stable nuclei. This process releases energy in the form of ionizing radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon and occurs due to the unstable atomic nuclei of certain elements. Some radioactive isotopes are naturally occurring, while others can be produced artificially, for example, in nuclear reactors or through the process of nuclear weapons production. The study and use of radioactivity have many applications, including in medicine (e.g., medical imaging, cancer treatment), energy production (e.g., nuclear power plants), and research (e.g., dating of rocks and artifacts). However, exposure to high levels of radiation can be harmful and potentially cause serious health effects, so it is important to handle and use radioactive materials carefully and responsibly. Radioactivity is related to the weak nuclear force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, where a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. The weak nuclear force is involved in the emission of the beta particle and the conversion of the neutron into a proton, leading to a change in the atomic number and thus the identity of the element. In contrast, alpha decay and gamma decay, which are also forms of radioactive decay, are not directly related to the weak nuclear force. Alpha decay is caused by the strong nuclear force, which holds the nucleus together, while gamma decay is a result of a change in the energy level of the nucleus.  In radioactive decay process different kinds of elements form due to emission of different particles or rays such as   Alpha ( ) particle emission: particle is a helium nucleus and is positively charged particle. In decay a nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. For example: thorium (Th) decayes into radium (Ra) by emitting alpha particle: This results in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by two and transforms the nucleus into a different element. Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus has too many protons and is not stable, and it releases energy in the form of the alpha particle to reach a more stable configuration. Alpha particles have a large mass and a low velocity, and they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air .    Beta ( ) particle emission: particle is similar to electron and hence holds negative charge. In decay a nucleus emits a high-energy electron or positron, also known as a beta particle. This results in a change in the number of protons in the nucleus and transforms the nucleus into a different element. For example: carbon (C-14) decayes into nitrogen (N-14) by emitting beta particle: Similarly, neutron turns into proton in beta decay: There are two types of beta decay: beta minus decay (emission of an electron) and beta plus decay (emission of a positron). In beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. In beta plus decay, a proton decays into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino. Beta decay is one of the three common types of radioactive decay, along with alpha decay and gamma decay. Beta particles have a low mass and a high velocity, and they can penetrate sheets of paper and even thin sheet of aluminum foil .    Gamma ( ) rays emission: ray is an electromagnetic radiation of very high energy and is neutral to the charge. If the nucleus is unstable due to access amount of energy then it releases rays. The composition of nucleus does not change due to gamma radiation emissioin. For example: high energetic Pb turns into low energetic Pb in gamma radiation:  star symbol indicates excited lead nucleus. Gamma rays have no rest mass and travel with the velocity of light and hence penetrate even thick plate of lead .    Electron ( ) Capture: it is another type of radioactive decay in which an inner orbital electron is captured by the nucleus and transforms into a neutron, resulting in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by one and the transformation of the nucleus into a different element. For example: flourine (F) turns into oxygen (O) due to positron emission: Another example is The captured electron combines with a proton to form a neutron, which remains inside the nucleus. This process releases energy in the form of gamma rays or X-rays. Electron capture is different from beta decay, which involves the emission of a beta particle (an electron or a positron).    Positron Emission: it is also known as beta plus decay, is a type of radioactive decay in which a nucleus emits a positron, which is the antiparticle of an electron. Positron emission occurs when a nucleus has too many protons and is not stable, and it releases energy in the form of the positron to reach a more stable configuration. For example: flourine (F) turns into oxygen (O) due to positron emission: The emitted positron quickly combines with an electron in the material, annihilating both particles and producing gamma rays. Positron emission is one of the three common types of radioactive decay, along with alpha decay and beta decay. In positron emission, a proton inside the nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino. This results in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by one and the transformation of the nucleus into a different element.      Strength of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays       Half-Life  The rate at which a radioactive isotope disintegrates is known as its half-life , which is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. The half-life of a radioactive isotope determines its stability and the length of time it can be used for various purposes, such as medical treatments or energy production. The representing the amount or number of atoms in a radioactive substance remains every after one half-life. For example, in second figure of , half-life of any one radiactive substance is 50 years, so half of the total number of atoms or its half amount disintegrate (decay) into new substances in every one half life.   Half life of nuclides    Remaining amount per Half-Life     % of atoms remaining     The remaining amount of substance can be determined by the following formula Here, is initial concentration of the substance, and is number of half-lives.   Carbon Dating  Carbon dating, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a method of determining the age of an object containing organic material by measuring the amount of carbon-14 it contains. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the Earth's upper atmosphere through the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen atoms. The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has remained constant for thousands of years, so the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample can be used to determine how long it has been since the death of the organism from which the sample was taken. The carbon-14 in a sample decays over time, and the amount remaining can be measured with a specialized machine called a mass spectrometer. The age of the sample can then be calculated based on the known decay rate of carbon-14. This method is typically used to date organic materials that are less than 50,000 years old, such as archaeological artifacts, fossils, and recent organic samples. It is important to note that carbon dating has certain limitations, such as the fact that it can only be used on materials that contain organic carbon, and that the results can be affected by various factors, such as contamination and the presence of other carbon isotopes in the sample. Additionally, the method can only provide approximate ages, as the rate of decay of carbon-14 is not constant, but can be influenced by factors such as the Earth's magnetic field and cosmic radiation. In the upper atmosphere Cosmic rays which was primarly protons turns into neutrons. These neutrons react with nitrogen to produce carbon-14. The carbon-14 then reacts with oxygen to to become gas. Plants consume this in photosynthesis process. Later animals eat plant and stores these C-14 atoms in their body. In beta decay process C-14 keeps turning into nitrogen such as The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is roughly constant because the organism continuously replaces carbon-14 as it decays. However, after the organism dies, the carbon-14 in its tissues begins to decay, and the carbon-14 to carbon-12 ratio begins to change. By measuring the carbon-14 to carbon-12 ratio in a sample and comparing it to the known decay rate of carbon-14, scientists can determine how long it has been since the sample died and estimate its age.    Binding Energy  Binding energy is the amount of energy required to separate a nucleons into the protons and neutrons. In an atomic nucleus, the protons and neutrons are held together by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances. The binding energy of a nucleus can be calculated by subtracting the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons from the total mass of the nucleus itself. According to Einstein's famous equation, , the mass difference between the two states is equivalent to the binding energy. The binding energy of a nucleus has important implications for both the stability of the nucleus and for the energy released during nuclear reactions. Nuclei with higher binding energy are generally more stable and less likely to undergo spontaneous decay, while nuclei with lower binding energy are more likely to undergo radioactive decay. Additionally, the energy released during nuclear reactions is directly proportional to the binding energy of the nucleus. When a nucleus is formed, protons and neutrons come together and bind to form the nucleus. This process is driven by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances to hold the particles together. The formation of a nucleus also leads to the release of energy. This energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiation and called the binding energy. It is the same amount of energy required to separate the protons and neutrons in the nucleus when broken down to individual components. For example: The deuterium ( ) has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. So when they break apart we expect the mass of deuterium atom equals the mass of one proton (i.e. ) and the mass of one neutron. Mass of one and mass of one neutron = 1.0087 u. Therefore the total mass of . The measured mass of however, is only which is less than the combined mass of proton and neutron. This loss of mass (also known as mass defect ) appears in the form of binding energy of the deuterium atom. Similarly when one deuterium nucleus combines with one tritium nucleus to form helium nucleus tremendous amount of energy released which was a binding energy. For example: . Hence, the mass defect in this case is given by: total mass of and total mass of . Hence the difference in these masses is a mass defect, . Note: Here is the atomic mass unit . . This is the approximate mass of the hydrogen atom. Atomic mass unit is also caled Dalton. we can also consider as 1 mole of anything is equal to Now, This mass defect appears in the form of binding energy which can be calculated by equation  Hence, energy released from this reaction is or, 17.8 MeV and . .    Binding Energy per Nucleon   Binding Energy Per Nucleon      The binding energy of a nucleus determines its stability against disintegration. The larger the binding energy, the more stable is the nucleus and vice a versa. The binding energy per nucleon, BE\/A = Binding energy of the nucleus \/ Total number of nucleons. It is found that the binding energy per nucleon varies from element to element. A graph is plotted with the mass number A of the nucleus along the X-axis and binding energy per nucleon along the Y-axis. The binding energy per nucleon increases sharply with mass number A upto 20. It increases slowly after . The curve becomes almost flat for mass number between 40 and 120. Beyond 120, it decreases slowly as A increases. The binding energy per nucleon reaches a maximum at A=56, corresponding to the iron nucleus ( ). Hence, iron has the most stable nucleus. At the lower end of the curve, smaller nuclei have relatively lower binding energy per nucleon compared to larger nuclei. This is because the attractive strong nuclear force, which holds the nucleons together, decreases rapidly with increasing distance between the nucleons. As a result, small nuclei tend to be less stable and more likely to undergo nuclear reactions, such as beta decay. At the higher end of the curve, larger nuclei have relatively lower binding energy per nucleon compared to smaller nuclei. This is because the repulsive electromagnetic force between the positively charged protons in the nucleus increases with increasing number of protons. This repulsive force limits the size of the nucleus and causes it to become less stable.    Nuclear Reactions  Nuclear reactions are the process in which nucleus of an atom changes. These changes can be either decay processes, in which the nucleus of an atom emits particles or radiation, or fusion processes, in which two or more atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier nucleus. There are two main types of nuclear reactions:  Nuclear Fission Reactions: These reactions involve the spontaneous decay of an unstable nucleus into a more stable form. Common types of nuclear decay reactions include alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.  Nuclear Fusion Reactions: These reactions involve the fusion of two atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, and is the reaction that powers the sun. Nuclear fusion reactions are difficult to achieve on Earth, but are being researched as a potential source of clean and abundant energy.     Nuclear Reactions    Nuclear Fission Reaction     Nuclear Fusion Reaction      In both types of reactions, the sum of the atomic numbers of the reactants must equal the sum of the atomic numbers of the products, and the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products, according to the law of conservation of matter and energy. In fission reactions, the mass defect of the original nucleus is converted into energy, which is released as kinetic energy of the fission products and as gamma radiation. This energy can be harnessed for practical purposes, such as generating electricity in nuclear power plants, or for destructive purposes, such as in atomic bombs. Binding energy in a fusion reaction refers to the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces between positively charged nuclei and bring them close enough together to form a heavier nucleus through a fusion process. When the nuclei are close enough, they can form a single nucleus through the strong force, releasing a large amount of energy in the process.    Effects of Radiation  In nuclear reaction emits alpha, beta, and other high enegy waves or particles that can knock out atoms or molecules to form ions. These ions come under ionizing radiation. Such radiation can damage living cells and affects protien or DNA molecules. There are several types of radiation, including: alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, X-rays, nuclear radiation, and cosmic radiation, etc. Cosmic radiation is high-energy radiation that originates from outside of the Earth's atmosphere. It consists of high-energy particles, including protons and electrons, that are produced by the Sun and other astronomical sources. Radiation doses doses are measured in the Sievert (Sv) unit. The sievert is used to describe the amount of ionizing radiation that has been absorbed by a material. The another unit of doses is Rads (short for \"radiation absorbed dose\"). It is used to quantify the amount of energy deposited in a material by ionizing radiation per unit mass. One rad is 0.01 joule of energy deposited in one kilogram of tissue. That is of energy deposited on the tissue. One sievert is equal to 100 rads. The sievert is the standard unit of measurement used to describe the amount of ionizing radiation that has been absorbed by the human body, and it is used to evaluate the potential health risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation. We receive 3.1 mSv per year from natural radiation resources, 3.1 mSv per year from medical and dental x-rays, and 0.4 mSv from mammogram. The total unavoidable radiation doses are about 6.2 mSv per year. The allowed safe radiation dose limit for a healthy human is . The risk of radiation induced cancer is much smaller than other hazardous activities such as smoking. Sources of radiation exposure is given in    Sources of Radiation Exposure      Nuclear Reactor  In nuclear fission reaction neutron is absorbed by unstable nucleus and get splitted into two or more small nuclides with the emission of another neutron\/s. Such neutrons may cause increasing nuclear fission reactions, called the chain reaction. A nuclear reactor is a device that is used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This reaction is the process by which atomic nuclei release energy through interactions with other particles. The heat produced by the fission reactions is used to generate steam, which in turn drives a turbine and generates electricity. Please click on the animation link: Nuclear Reactor Plant The core of a nuclear reactor contains fuel rods, which contain fuel pellets made of nuclear fuel, such as uranium dioxide. The fuel rods are surrounded by coolant, which is used to transfer heat from the core to a steam generator. The steam generator is used to produce steam, which drives the turbine to generate electricity. In addition to the fuel rods, the core of a nuclear reactor also contains control rods, which are used to regulate the rate of fission reactions by absorbing excess neutrons. The control rods can be moved up and down within the core to control the reaction rate.   "

  "title": "Changes in Matter",
  "body": " Changes in Matter   Matter can undergo basically two types of changes. They are:   Physical change: It is such a change in matter that do not alter its chemical composition. For examples:melting, freezing, boiling, condensation, and evaporation. Physical changes are kind of two-way trafic. The material transform its shape and state multiple times. For example, making jewelry from gold bar and molding them back into gold bar again, making sword from iron bar and converting sword in an iron bar again.   Chemical change: It is such a change in matter that alter its chemical composition. Fpr examples: burning, rusting, and the formation of a chemical compound. It is a one-way trafic where material transform its physical properties but never regains the original properties by the physical process. For example, Baking a cake, making yogurt from milk. The physical properties of the milk, such as its texture and flavor, are also altered in the process. Formation of a new chemical compound such as water from hydrogen and oxygen is also a chemical change.      The Classification of Matter  Instead of three phases (or states) of matter, there are three different classes of matter based on its composition and properties. They are elements, compounds, and mixture .  Elements: An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by any chemical means. Elements are the building blocks of all matter and are composed of only one type of atom. Examples of elements include hydrogen, oxygen, and gold.  Compounds: A compound is a pure substance that is made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio. Compounds have different properties from their constituent elements and cannot be separated into their individual elements by physical means. Examples of compounds include water ( ), salt ( ), and glucose ( ).  Mixtures: A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in which each substance retains its own chemical properties. Mixtures can be separated into their individual components by physical means. There are two main types of mixtures: homogeneous mixtures, where the substances are evenly mixed, and heterogeneous mixtures, where the substances are not evenly mixed. Examples of mixtures include air, fruit juice, and concrete.    In homogeneous mixture substances are evenly mixed and have the same composition throughout. Homogeneous mixture is also called a solution Here are some examples of homogeneous mixtures: Salt water: When salt is dissolved in water, the result is a homogeneous mixture, in which the salt and water are evenly distributed throughout the solution. Air: Air is a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, that are evenly mixed and have the same composition throughout the entire volume of air. Honey: Honey is a homogeneous mixture of sugar and water, with the sugar and water evenly mixed throughout the entire substance. Vinegar: Vinegar is a homogeneous mixture of water and acetic acid, with the water and acetic acid evenly mixed throughout the entire substance. Milk: Milk is a homogeneous mixture of water, fat, proteins, and sugars, with the substances evenly mixed throughout the entire substance.  In heterogeneous mixture substances are not evenly mixed and have different compositions in different parts of the mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are easy to identify, as the individual substances are easily visible and can be separated from one another by physical means. Here are some examples of heterogeneous mixtures: Fruit salad: A mixture of fruit, such as apples, bananas, and grapes, cut into pieces and combined in a bowl is a heterogeneous mixture. Each piece of fruit has its own unique composition, and the composition of the mixture changes from one part of the mixture to another. Granola: A mixture of oats, nuts, dried fruit, and sweeteners is a heterogeneous mixture, as the ingredients are not evenly mixed and the composition of the mixture changes from one part of the mixture to another. Sand and water: A mixture of sand and water is a heterogeneous mixture, as the sand particles settle to the bottom of the container and the water is clear. The composition of the mixture changes from the top of the mixture to the bottom. Soil: Soil is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, air, and water, and is a heterogeneous mixture as the composition of the soil changes from one part of the soil to another. Concrete: Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, gravel, and water, and is a heterogeneous mixture, as the composition of the concrete changes f rom one part of the mixture to another.   Classification of Matter       Atomic Theory  Atomic theory is the foundation of modern chemistry and provides a basic understanding of the nature of matter. The theory states that all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element. Atoms are indivisible: Atoms are the smallest units of matter that can exist and cannot be broken down into smaller units. Atoms are identical: Atoms of the same element are identical and have the same number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Atoms have structure: Atoms have a small central nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons in shells. Atoms are arranged in the periodic table: Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons, electrons, and neutrons and are arranged in the periodic table according to their atomic number, which is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. Atoms can bond to form molecules: Atoms can bond together to form molecules by sharing or exchanging electrons. The properties of molecules are determined by the type of atoms and the way they are bonded together. Atoms can be ionized: Atoms can gain or lose electrons to become positively or negatively charged ions. Ions play an important role in many chemical reactions.   Molecule: A molecule is the smallest unit of a substance that retains the chemical properties of that substance and can exist as a separate entity. It is composed of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. In a molecule, the atoms are held together by chemical bonds, which are formed by the sharing or exchange of electrons between the atoms. The type of bonds and the arrangement of atoms in a molecule determine the chemical and physical properties of the substance. Molecules can be formed from a single type of atom, such as a molecule of oxygen ( ), or from different types of atoms, such as a molecule of water ( ). The number of atoms in a molecule and the type of atoms can also vary, giving rise to a vast array of different molecules, each with its own unique properties. Molecules are the building blocks of matter and play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes, including chemical reactions, phase transitions, and the formation of materials. A deep understanding of the structure and properties of molecules is essential for many scientific and engineering disciplines, including chemistry, biology, materials science, and environmental science.   Difference between molecule and compound: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. A compound is a substance made up of two or more different elements that are chemically combined in a fixed ratio. The main difference between a molecule and a compound is that a molecule is a collection of atoms that are bonded together, whereas a compound is a substance that consists of molecules made up of different elements in a fixed ratio. For example, water ( ) is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a fixed ratio of 2:1. The smallest unit of water that retains its chemical properties is a molecule of water, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom chemically bonded together. Another example is table salt (NaCl), which is a compound made up of sodium and chlorine atoms in a fixed ratio of 1:1. The smallest unit of salt that retains its chemical properties is a molecule of salt, which is made up of one sodium atom and one chlorine atom chemically bonded together.  Hydrogen gas is made out of molecules. It is not a compound. Oxygen gas is made out of molecules and is also not a compound. They are made out of two atoms of the same element. Similarly, Ozone gas ( ), nitrogen gas ( ), chlorine substance ( ) are molecule. However, carbon dioxide gas ( ) is a compound and molecule both, similarly, amonia ( ) is a compound and molecule both. Because they are made out of two different elements. Meaning all compounds are molecules but all molecules are not compounds.  Some substances are elemental such as iron bar (Fe), liquid mercury (Hg), helium gas (He), gold jewlry (Au), etc., some are molecular such as hydrogen gas ( ), oxygen gas ( ), ozone gas ( ), water ( ), methane ( ), carbon dioxide gas ( ), amonia ( ), diamond ( ), glucose ( ) etc. diamond is a pure form of carbon, but it is not an element. An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means, while a molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together.   "

  "title": "The Periodic Table",
  "body": " The Periodic Table   The periodic table of elements is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements based on their atomic structure, chemical properties, and electron configurations. The modern periodic table consists of 118 elements and is arranged in rows and columns based on their atomic number and electron configurations. The periodic law states that the physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers . This means that when elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, their properties exhibit a recurring or periodic pattern.  The discovery of the periodic table is generally attributed to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who published his version of the table in 1869. However, other scientists, including John Newlands and Julius Lothar Meyer, also made significant contributions to the development of the periodic table around the same time. Mendeleev's table was particularly influential because he left gaps for undiscovered elements and predicted the properties of these elements based on their position in the table. When these elements were discovered, their properties were found to match Mendeleev's predictions, which helped to establish the credibility of the periodic table .    The Periodic Table     Here is a general guide on how to read the periodic table:  Element symbols: Each element is represented by a one- or two-letter symbol. For example, \"H\" represents hydrogen and \"He\" represents helium. , Atomic number: Each element's atomic number is located above or below its symbol. The atomic number represents the number of protons in the element's nucleus.  Element name: The name of each element is located below its symbol.  Groups : Elements with similar chemical properties are organized into vertical columns called groups or families. There are 18 groups in the modern periodic table, numbered 1 to 18 from left to right. Elements in the same group have similar chemical and physical properties.  Periods: The elements in the periodic table are arranged in horizontal rows called periods. The period number represents the highest energy level or shell occupied by electrons in that element.  Atomic mass: The average atomic mass of each element is located below its symbol. This value represents the average mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.  Blocks: The periodic table is also divided into four blocks, based on the electron configuration of the outermost shell. These blocks are s-block, p-block, d-block, and f-block.    The modern periodic table is divided into two main categories: the \"A\" groups, also known as the main group elements, and the \"B\" groups, also known as the transition metals. The A groups, or main group elements, are located in columns 1, 2, and 13 to 18 of the periodic table. These elements are also known as the representative elements, and they are characterized by having valence electrons in the s and p orbitals of their outermost energy level. The A groups are further divided into two subcategories: the alkali metals (Group 1) and the alkaline earth metals (Group 2), which are located on the far left side of the periodic table, and the post-transition metals (Groups 13-16), the halogens (Group 17), and the noble gases (Group 18), which are located on the right side of the table. Rare earth elements (Group 3) are metallic chemical elements that are crucial components of many modern technologies, including smartphones, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and medical devices. These elements are similar in their electronic structure and chemical properties, and they all have partially filled 4f electron shells. Because the electronic properties of these elements are highly similar, they are difficult to separate, which is one reason why rare earth element extraction and refining can be challenging and expensive. Despite their name, rare earth elements are not actually rare. They are found in relatively small quantities in the Earth's crust, and are often difficult and expensive to extract and refine.  Most post-transition metals are actually is non-metals. Non-metals are elements that do not have metallic properties and are typically poor conductors of heat and electricity. The non-metals are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table and are grouped together in several columns, or groups. The main groups of non-metals in the periodic table are:  Group 14 (Carbon Group): This group includes the non-metal carbon (C), which is the basis for all organic molecules, as well as the metalloids silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge).  Group 15 (Nitrogen Group): This group includes the non-metal nitrogen (N), which is a key component of the Earth's atmosphere, as well as the non-metals phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi).  Group 16 (Chalcogens): This group includes the non-metals oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), polonium (Po), and livermorium (Lv). The chalcogens are known for their ability to form compounds with a wide range of other elements, and they are involved in many important biological and industrial processes. For example, oxygen is essential for respiration and combustion, while sulfur is used in the production of fertilizers and other chemicals. Selenium and tellurium are used in the manufacture of semiconductors, while polonium has important nuclear applications. They are non-metals, and they have relatively high electronegativities and melting points. They also tend to form compounds with other elements that are covalent or ionic in nature.  Group 17 (Halogens): This group includes the non-metals fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). The halogens are highly reactive and form a variety of compounds.  Group 18 (Noble Gases): This group includes the non-metals helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). The noble gases are generally unreactive and have very low boiling points.      Electronic Configuration  Electronic configuration is an arrangement of electrons in an atom. The electronic configuration of an atom is typically represented using the notation known as the \"Aufbau principle,\" which states that electrons fill the lowest energy levels first, followed by successively higher energy levels. The electronic configuration of an atom is important because it determines the chemical properties and reactivity of that atom or molecule. The electronic configuration of an atom can also be represented using a diagram known as an \"orbital diagram,\" which shows the distribution of electrons in the various sublevels of the atom. A shell is a group of electrons that occupy the same principal energy level in an atom or molecule. The shells are numbered using integers, where the first shell (or innermost shell) has a principal quantum number of 1, the second shell has a principal quantum number of 2, and so on. The in 1, 2, 3, ... are the shells and s, p, d are the subshells in an atom. Each shell can hold a maximum number of electrons, which is given by , where is the principal quantum number of the shell. A subshell is a division of a shell that describes the shape and energy of an electron's orbit within that shell. The subshells are designated using the letters and so on. Each subshell is associated with a specific angular momentum quantum number, or azimuthal quantum number, which is given by an integer value ranging from to , where is the principal quantum number of the shell. The subshell is spherical in shape and can hold up to two electrons , the subshell has a dumbbell or peanut shape and can hold up to six electrons , the d subshell has a more complex shape and can hold up to 10 electrons, and the f subshell has an even more complex shape and can hold up to 14 electrons. Other subshells exist for higher principal quantum numbers, but they are less commonly encountered in everyday chemistry. In summary, a shell is a group of electrons that occupy the same principal energy level, while a subshell is a division of a shell that describes the shape and energy of an electron's orbit within that shell. The electronic configuration of an atom is typically written using the format:    Orbital Diagram and Electrons in Shells    Orbital diagram     Electrons in shells        Electronic Structure  The electronic structure of some of the Group IA elements are written as: The electronic structure of some of the Group VIIIA elements are written as: The electronic structure of some other elements are written as: From the given electronic structures we can find that Group IA elements contain only 1 electron in its outermost orbit which is the s -orbital (or, subshell). The Group IIA elements contain 3 electrons in its outermost orbit which is again the s-orbital and so on. The Group IIIA elements contain 3 electrons in its outermost orbit which is the p-orbital and so on. The Group VIIIA elements contain 2 electrons in helium atom and 8 electrons for rest of the atoms.    Octet Rule  The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration of eight valence electrons in their outermost energy level or shell. The rule is based on the observation that elements in the second row of the periodic table (i.e., those with atomic numbers 5 through 10) tend to form stable compounds by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have eight electrons in their outermost shell, which is also called the valence shell . This configuration is known as the octet configuration or the noble gas configuration, and it is particularly stable because it closely resembles the electron configuration of the noble gases in the same row. The octet rule is not a hard and fast rule and there are many exceptions to it. For example, some elements, such as hydrogen and helium, only have a maximum of two electrons in their outermost shell, while some elements in the third row of the periodic table can accommodate more than eight electrons in their outermost shell. Nonetheless, the octet rule provides a useful framework for predicting the likely electron configurations of atoms and the types of chemical bonds that they can form.    Valency  Valency describe the combining power of an atom or a group of atoms with other atoms. It is determined by the number of electrons an atom can gain, lose or share when it reacts with another atom. The valency of an element is usually a whole number that indicates the number of electrons an atom of that element can gain or lose in order to achieve a stable configuration.  The valency of an element is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell of its atoms, which is also known as the valence shell. The valency of most elements can be predicted by looking at their position in the periodic table. For example, elements in Group 1 of the periodic table have a valency of 1, while elements in Group 2 have a valency of 2, and elements in Group 3 have a valency of 3. Elements in Group 15 have a valency of -3, elements in Group 16 have a valency of -2, elements in Group 17 have a valency of -1, and elements in Group 18 have a valency of 0 since they have already achieved a stable configuration. Elements in Group 14 however, have a valency of as these atoms either gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons in order to obtain stable configuration.  Valency is important in understanding chemical bonding and chemical reactions. For example, elements with a valency of 1 can form compounds by sharing one electron with another atom, while elements with a valency of 2 can share or lose two electrons. By knowing the valency of an element, chemists can predict the types of chemical bonds that it can form with other elements and the chemical properties of the resulting compounds.   "

  "body": " Chemical Bonds & Equations   Chemical bonding is the process by which atoms combine to form molecules or other chemical compounds. Chemical bonding allows atoms to achieve the most stable configuration by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. There are several types of chemical bonding, including covalent bonding, ionic bonding, and metallic bonding. However, there are other types of bonding also occurs by the substance such as polar bonding, non-polar bonding, coordination bonding, molecular bonding, hydrogen bonding, and Van der waals' bonding.     Covalent bond: In covalent bonding atoms share electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This is the most common between non-metal atoms. Covalent bonding can take on a variety of forms including single, double, and triple bonds. For examples: in hydrogen molecule ( ), water molecule ( ), methan gas molecule ( ), diamond ( ), etc. Covalent bonding    Ionic bond: In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from one atom to another, forming positively charged cations and negatively charged anions that are attracted to each other by electrostatic forces. This bonding is most common between metals and nonmetals. For examples: in Salt molecule ( ), Iron oxide molecule ( ), Calcium carbonate , magnesium oxide ( ), potassium iodide , etc. ionic bonding    Metallic bond: In metallic bonding, positively charged metal ions are surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons, which are free to move throughout the metal lattice. This results in the formation of a strong metallic bond that is responsible for many of the physical properties of metals, such as their high melting points and conductivity. mettalic bonding .  Molecular bonding, typically refers to covalent bonding due to polar molecules. molecular bonding   In Van der waal's bonding, or van der Waals forces, refer to weak intermolecular attractions between molecules or atoms. These forces arise due to temporary fluctuations in the distribution of electrons in molecules or atoms.  The type of chemical bonding that occurs between atoms is determined by the properties of the atoms involved, including their electronegativity, electron configuration, and the conditions under which the reaction occurs. Understanding chemical bonding is important in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and engineering, as it underlies the formation and properties of all types of matter.    Naming of Compounds  There are a few general rules for naming molecules in chemistry, which vary slightly depending on the type of molecule being named. Here are some basic guidelines:    Naming simple covalent compounds: The first element in the formula is named first and the full element name is used. For example: in NaCl, the first name is The second element is named as though it were an anion (negative ion), with the suffix added to the root of the element name. For example: in NaCl, the second name is , in CaO: calcium oxide. Prefixes are used to indicate the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule. The prefix is usually omitted for the first element in the formula. For example: the name of is Carbon dioxide , and the CO is carbon monoxide .     Naming ionic compounds: The cation (positive ion) is named first, followed by the anion (negative ion). The name of the cation is the same as the element name. The name of the anion is derived from the root of the element name, with the suffix added. If the cation can have different charges, a Roman numeral is used to indicate the charge. For example: the name of iron (III) chloride is FeCl_3 , and mercury (II) Oxide is HgO .     Naming acids: If the anion name ends in , the acid is named with the prefix and the suffix , followed by the word \"acid\". If the anion name ends in , the acid is named with the suffix , followed by the word \"acid\". If the anion name ends in , the acid is named with the suffix , followed by the word \"acid\". For example: HCl - hydrochloric acid.     Naming organic compounds: The root of the name comes from the number of carbon atoms in the molecule (meth-, eth-, prop-, but-, etc.). Functional groups (such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) are indicated by suffixes or prefixes. Numbering of the carbon atoms in the main chain starts at the end closest to a functional group, and the position of the functional group is indicated by a number. For example: - ethanol.     The common name of some compounds: Water ( ), methane ( ), ammonia ( ), and Chalk: ( ).    Molecular Formula  Molecular formula can be written by knowing the valency of the elements. The valency of an element is the number of electrons it can donate, accept, or share during a chemical reaction. First identify the elements present in the compound then Determine the valency of each element based on its position in the periodic table or by consulting a table of valencies. Determine the number of atoms of each element required to balance the valencies. This can be done by finding the least common multiple of the valencies for each element. Write the molecular formula by indicating the number of atoms for each element as subscripts next to the element symbol. Make sure to reduce the subscripts to the lowest whole number ratio. For example, let's determine the molecular formula for magnesium chloride. Magnesium has a valency of +2 and chlorine has a valency of -1. Now exchange the valency and place them to the bottom of opposite elements by dropping their signs as shown in below Hence, the molecular formula of magnesium chloride is Another example is the molecular formula for calcium oxide. Calcium has a valency of +2 and oxygen has a valency of -2.  Hence, calcium oxide is written as     Free Radicals  Free radicals are atoms, molecules or ions that have an unpaired electron in their outermost shell. They are highly reactive and unstable because they seek to pair their unpaired electron with another electron, either from another molecule or from another part of the same molecule. This process can cause damage to cells and tissues, and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and aging. Free radicals can be generated through normal metabolic processes in the body, as well as through exposure to environmental factors such as radiation, pollution, cigarette smoke, and certain chemicals. Some of the most common free radicals in the body include superoxide, hydroxyl, and nitric oxide radicals. To neutralize free radicals, the body relies on antioxidants, which are molecules that can donate an electron to the free radical without becoming unstable themselves. Antioxidants can be obtained from a variety of sources, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and selenium are all examples of antioxidants that can help neutralize free radicals in the body.  Free radicals are formed when a covalent bond in a molecule is broken with each fragment taking one of the shared electrons of the bond. For example when water molecules is broken The dots are unpaired electrons. Here is called a hydroxyle radical .    Polyatmic Ions  Polyatomic ions are ions composed of two or more atoms that are covalently bonded together and carry a net electrical charge. They are commonly found in many chemical compounds, including salts, acids, and bases. Polyatomic ions can have either a positive or negative charge, depending on the number of electrons they have gained or lost. Some common examples of polyatomic ions include:  Hydroxide ion : This ion consists of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom and has a negative charge. It is found in bases such as sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide . Ammonium ion : This ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms and has a positive charge. It is found in compounds such as ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate . Carbonate ion : This ion consists of one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms and has a negative charge. It is found in compounds such as calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate . Sulfate ion : This ion consists of one sulfur atom and four oxygen atoms and has a negative charge. It is found in compounds such as magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate . Phosphate ion This ion consists of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms and has a negative charge. It is found in compounds such as calcium phosphate and sodium phosphate .  The properties and behavior of polyatomic ions depend on the specific atoms and bonds that make up the ion. They play important roles in many chemical reactions and are essential to many biological processes.    Chemical Equations  A chemical equation is a representation of a chemical reaction using symbols and formulas to show the reactants and products involved in the reaction. Chemical equations are written in a balanced form, meaning that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. This is because the law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, only rearranged. The general form of a chemical equation is: Reactants → Products For example, the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water is: This equation shows that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to form two molecules of water . The equation is balanced because there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation.  Chemical equations can also include coefficients, which are used to balance the equation. Coefficients are numbers placed in front of the chemical formulas to indicate the number of molecules or atoms involved in the reaction. For example, the balanced equation for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to form ammonia is: In this equation, a coefficient of 3 is placed in front of the to balance the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation.    Balancing a chemical equation  Balancing a chemical equation involves adjusting the coefficients of the reactants and products to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to balance a chemical equation:  Write the unbalanced equation. Identify the reactants and products and write them down using their chemical formulas.  Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. This will help you determine which coefficients need to be adjusted.  Begin balancing the equation by adjusting the coefficients of the compounds that contain the most atoms first. Start with the compounds that have two or more atoms of an element.  Check the number of atoms of each element again after adjusting the coefficients. Continue adjusting the coefficients until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.  Finally, double-check that the equation is fully balanced by counting the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.    For example, let's balance the equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water: Unbalanced equation:    Step 1: Write the unbalanced equation.   Step 2: Count the number of atoms of each element.   Reactants: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms   Products: 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom   Step 3: Balance the equation by adjusting the coefficients.    Step 4: Check the number of atoms of each element again.   Reactants: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms   Products: 4 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms   Step 5: Double-check that the equation is fully balanced.   Reactants: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms   Products: 2 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms  The balanced equation is    "

  "body": " Chemical Reactions   There are several types of chemical reactions, including:   Combination reactions: In a combination reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product. The general form of a combination reaction is:    Decomposition reactions: In a decomposition reaction, a single reactant breaks down into two or more products. The general form of a decomposition reaction is:    Single replacement reactions: In a single replacement reaction, an element replaces another element in a compound to form a new compound and a new element. The general form of a single replacement reaction is:    Double replacement reactions: In a double replacement reaction, the cations and anions of two different compounds switch places to form two new compounds. The general form of a double replacement reaction is:    Combustion reactions: In a combustion reaction, a fuel (often a hydrocarbon) reacts with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat. The general form of a combustion reaction is: fuel + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.   Acid-base reactions: In an acid-base reaction, an acid reacts with a base to produce a salt and water. The general form of an acid-base reaction is: acid + base → salt + water.  Understanding the different types of chemical reactions is important in predicting the products of a reaction and in understanding the behavior of chemicals in different environments.    The Mole   Mole is a unit used to measure the amount of a substance. One mole of a substance is defined as the amount of substance that contains the same number of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) as there are in 12 grams of carbon-12. This number is known as Avogadro's number, N_o and is approximately particles per mole. For example, one mole of water contains water molecules, while one mole of sodium chloride contains sodium ions and chloride ions. The mole is a convenient unit for chemists because it allows them to compare the amounts of different substances on the basis of the number of particles they contain, rather than their mass or volume. The number of atoms or molecules or anything in 1 mole of any substance is always the same as Avogadro's number.   Atomic mass unit (amu) is a unit of mass used to express the relative masses of atoms and molecules. It is defined as one twelfth (1\/12) of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, which is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. This means that the mass of one proton or one neutron is approximately 1 amu, and the mass of an electron is much smaller, about 0.0005 amu. The atomic mass of an element, which is the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes, is expressed in amu. The use of atomic mass units is convenient because it allows us to compare the masses of different atoms and molecules on a relative scale. For example, the mass of a hydrogen atom is about 1 amu, while the mass of an oxygen atom is about 16 amu.   Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, typically expressed in units of grams per mole (g\/mol). It is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule or formula unit of a compound. The molar mass is an important concept in chemistry as it is used to convert between the mass of a substance and the number of moles of that substance. It is also used in stoichiometric calculations to determine the quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions.     How many atoms are there in 100 g of iron?    To determine the number of atoms present in 100 g of iron, we first need to know the atomic mass of iron. The atomic mass (or Molar mass) of iron (Fe) is approximately 55.85 g\/mol. We can use this information and Avogadro's number, which is approximately atoms\/mol, to calculate the number of atoms in 100 g of iron:  Calculate the number of moles of iron in 100 g:   Calculate the number of atoms in 1.79 moles of iron: = 1.79 mol atoms\/mol = atoms   Therefore, there are approximately atoms present in 100 g of iron.

  "title": "Crystalline Solids",
  "body": " Crystalline Solids    Crystal structure of Solids    Diamond     Graphite     Metallic Solid     Molecular Solid      On the basis of chemical bonding there are four main types of crystalline solids:   Ionic solids: These solids are made up of positively charged ions and negatively charged ions held together by electrostatic forces. These molecules are hard and posses high melting point. Examples include sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium fluoride [ ].   Covalent solids: These solids are made up of atoms held together by covalent bonds. These molecules are very hard and posses very high melting point. Examples include diamond [ ] and graphite [ ].   Metallic solids: These solids are made up of metal atoms held together by metallic bonds. These molecules can be deformed, have metallic luster, high electrical and thermal conductivity. Examples include copper, iron, and gold. [ ]   Molecular solids: These solids are made up of molecules held together by intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and dipole-dipole interactions. These molecules are soft and posses low melting point. Examples include ice and solid carbon dioxide [ ].      Polar & Nonploar Molecules   Polar and nonpolar molecules    Polar-polar interaction     Polar-nonpolar interaction     Nonpolar-nonpolar interaction      A polar molecule has none symmetrical distribution of electrons between its atoms resulting in a permanent dipole moment. This means that the molecule has a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other end. The polarity of a molecule is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the atoms that make up the molecule. If the electronegativity difference is large enough, the molecule will be polar. Examples of polar molecules include water , ammonia , and hydrogen chloride . Polar molecules are important in many biological and chemical processes, including the formation of hydrogen bonds, the solubility of molecules in water, and the function of enzymes. Polar molecules attract each other due to the presence of partial positive and partial negative charges on opposite ends of the molecule. This attraction is known as a dipole-dipole interaction [ ].  A nonpolar molecule has no separation of charge, meaning that the electrons are shared equally between the atoms in the molecule. This occurs when the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the molecule is zero or very small. Examples of nonpolar molecules include: carbon dioxide , methane , ethane , nitrogen gas , oxygen gas , benzene . These molecules do not have a positive or negative pole, which means that they do not have a permanent dipole moment. Nonpolar molecules are generally less reactive than polar molecules and have lower melting and boiling points [ ].  Nonpolar molecules however, interact through weak van der Waals forces, which are caused by temporary fluctuations in electron density that create a temporary dipole moment. In contrast, partial positive and negative charges on different parts of the polar molecule allow polar molecules to form strong electrostatic attractions with other polar or nonpolar molecules or ions [ ].   \"Like dissolves like\" is a principle in chemistry that states that substances with similar polarities and intermolecular forces tend to dissolve in each other. In other words, a solvent will dissolve a solute if the intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute molecules are similar. Polar molecules have an uneven distribution of electrons and have a partial positive and partial negative charge. Nonpolar molecules have an even distribution of electrons and do not have a net electrical charge. When a polar solute is added to a polar solvent, the polar molecules of the solute interact with the polar molecules of the solvent through intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. This makes it easier for the solute to dissolve in the solvent. Similarly, when a nonpolar solute is added to a nonpolar solvent, the nonpolar molecules of the solute interact with the nonpolar molecules of the solvent through van der Waals forces, making it easier for the solute to dissolve in the solvent. On the other hand, if a polar solute is added to a nonpolar solvent, or vice versa, the polar and nonpolar molecules do not interact as easily, and the solute may not dissolve in the solvent. For example: sugar (a polar solute) does not dissolve well in oil (a nonpolar solvent) because their polarities do not match. Oil (a nonpolar solute) does not dissolve well in water (a polar solvent) because their polarities do not match. Water can be an effective cleaning agent for removing certain types of dirt, such as dust or mud, from surfaces like floors, walls, or furniture. However, if the dirt is greasy or oily, water alone may not be enough to remove it, and additional cleaning agents or solvents (such as soap) may be needed.   "

  "title": "Solution",
  "body": " Solution   A solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. The substance that dissolves is called the solute , and the substance that does the dissolving is called the solvent . When the solute dissolves in the solvent, the resulting solution is a uniform mixture, called solution.  Solubility is the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent to form a solution. The solubility of a substance depends on various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the solute and solvent. In general, \" like dissolves like ,\" meaning that substances with similar chemical properties tend to dissolve in each other. The amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent is limited by the solubility of the solute in the solvent. When a solution contains the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in the solvent at a given temperature and pressure, is said to be a saturated solution. If more solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve and will form a separate phase, such as a solid precipitate or gas bubbles.   Concentration: The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute dissolved in a specific amount of solvent or solution. The term \"saturated\" and \"unsaturated\" are used to describe the concentration of solute in a solution. A saturated solution contains maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. No more solute can be dissolved in the solvent of the saturated solution without increasing the temperature or pressure. Any additional solute added to the solution will not dissolve and will remain as a solid. On the other hand, an unsaturated solution contains less than the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. In an unsaturated solution, more solute can be added and dissolved in the solvent. It's important to note that a solution can also be supersaturated , which means it contains more solute than what can theoretically be dissolved at a given temperature and pressure. Supersaturated solutions are not stable and can spontaneously crystallize, forming a precipitate, or solid, out of excess solute.   Solubility of various solutes in water.      Types of Solution  There are several types of solutions, based on their composition and properties. Here are some common types of solutions:   Homogeneous solutions: These are solutions that have uniform composition and properties throughout. The solute particles are evenly distributed in the solvent. Examples include saltwater, sugar water, and ethanol-water mixtures.   Heterogeneous solutions: These are solutions that have non-uniform composition and properties. The solute particles are not evenly distributed in the solvent. Examples include suspensions, emulsions, and colloids.   Dilute solutions: These are solutions that have a low concentration of solute. The amount of solute is relatively small compared to the amount of solvent. Examples include a drop of food coloring in a glass of water or a pinch of salt in a pot of soup.   Concentrated solutions: These are solutions that have a high concentration of solute. The amount of solute is relatively large compared to the amount of solvent. Examples include concentrated sulfuric acid, concentrated sodium hydroxide, and concentrated ammonia solutions.   Saturated solutions: These are solutions that contain the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. Any additional solute added to the solution will not dissolve and will remain as a solid. Examples include sugar-water solutions and saltwater solutions.   Unsaturated solutions: These are solutions that contain less than the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. More solute can be added to the solution and dissolved. Examples include weak tea and weak coffee.   Supersaturated solutions: These are solutions that contain more solute than what can theoretically dissolve at a given temperature and pressure. These solutions are not stable and can spontaneously crystallize, forming a precipitate or solid out of excess solute. Examples include supersaturated sugar-water solutions and supersaturated sodium acetate solutions.    There are also several types of solutions based on the phases of the solute and solvent. Here are some common types of solutions:   Solid-solid solutions: It is also known as solid solutions or alloys, are homogeneous mixtures of two or more solid elements or compounds. In a solid solution, the atoms of one component are dispersed uniformly throughout the crystal lattice of the other component, resulting in a single, continuous phase. Examples of solid-solid solutions include brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc; steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon; and bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin.   Liquid-liquid solutions: These are solutions in which the solute and solvent are both liquids. Examples include milk in water, ethanol in water, and benzene in toluene.   Gas-liquid solutions: also known as gas solutions. These are solutions in which the solute is a gas that dissolves in a liquid solvent. Examples include cold drink, carbon dioxide in water, oxygen in blood, and nitrogen in beer.   Solid-liquid solutions: Here solid is solute and liquid is solvent. For example: salt water solution, sugar water solution.     "
