  "body": "   Physical science is an introductory book for non-scinece major students. It consists of introduction of physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in physical science course. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some high school mathematical skills such as algebra and geometry.  Learning skills by memorization cannot work efficiently in learning physical sciences. It is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into ten chapters that covers the syllabus of physical science at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. The topics in this book have been carefully selected to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of science and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to inform how to investigate and approach problems in introductory level sciences. This book strives to guide readers to learn physical science in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted.  "

  "title": "Significant Figures",
  "body": " Significant Figures    significant figures Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be 287.5 cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the first digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) he\/she could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the first digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter how accuratly you measure things, there is always some inaccuracy in every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.    1000 has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000. : notice that ”point” after the zero! This has four significant digits, because the decimal point tells us that the measurement was made to the nearest unit, so the zero is not just a placeholder.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the ”.0” tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then If it had four sig. fig. then 200.0 is sufficient.    Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:  All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.  All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.  Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number ”540” there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.  Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.  Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped. If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it. If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded. If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error.    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).     Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to ”place” the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.     Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits:   For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is ”odd” and followed by a ”5”, then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits.  For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is ”even” and followed by a ”5”, then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.        Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures    Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as:  Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures as      Science and Religion  Science is a study of understanding the natural phenomena based on observation and experimental evidence acquired by scientific method. It is always skeptical and never correct to 100%. Religion on the other hand is understanding the purpose, source, and meaning of our world based on faith. Many principles are accepted without asking any question.   "

  "title": "Ancient Observations",
  "body": " Ancient Observations   We have been observing sky solar system since the begining of human history. It seems that the sun is revolving around the earth. On such observation the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD came up with the idea of Geocentric Theory in which unmoving earth is at the center of the universe and the sun is revolving around it. He was able to predict fairly accurate positions of celectial objects and his theory was the longest ever (about 2500 years) accepted theory of universe. However, his theory was not able to explain Retrograde Motion correctly.    Retrograde Motion  Sometimes celestial objects such as some planets appear to move backward in their orbit around the sun as shown in the animation below. Retrograde Motion Please click on start button in the animation. In the animation retrograde motion is shown for the planet \"Mars\". The projection of mars in the sky is shown by the background stars. We notice that when mars reaches certain positions it looks suddenly moving backward as seen from the earth and after some time in the year it again starts moving forward in its orbit around the sun. Such an apparent reverse motion of the planets is called retrograde motion. Ptolmy's geocentric theory was not able to explain this event cleary. So in 1543, Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus publish revised but completly radical theory called Heliocentric Theory . In this theory the unmovable sun at the center of the universe nd all the planets are moving around it in the specific oribit. This theory was able to solve almost all the puzzles of the time. In heliocentric model of the solar system Copernicus proposed that the Earth has three distinct motions: a daily axial rotation, an annual rotation about the Sun, and a precessional motion of its axis.    Tides  The regular rise and fall of ocean water is called tides.Tides are water waves that occur naturally in ocean due to force of gravity on earth surface due to the moon and the sun. Please watch this video to understand the tides. Tide Formation Because of moon's gravity water bulges out of the earth surface and keep getting dragged as the moon moves around the earth. The effect of moon's gravity is more on the earth surface than the sun's gravity due to their distant positions. When sun and moon are located along the same direction high tide is higher than normal high tide and low tide is lower than normal low tide and they are collectivly called Spring Tide . When sun and moon are at right angles to each other than high tide and low tide both are shorter than usual and they are called Neep Tide . There are alawyes two high and two low tides in every 24 hours.    Some more observations  In the animation window, observe some more natural phenomena and prepare your own hypotheses. celestial sphere The yellow circle in the animation is called an Ecliptic line. It is an apparent path of the sun in the sky as viewed from the earth over the course of a year.   "

  "title": "Units and Measurements",
  "body": " Units and Measurements   Physics endeavors to decipher natural laws. In order to describe a natural law (or physical law) a measurement of varieties of physical quantities are essential. measurement Measurement is a process that uses numbers and units to describe a physical quantity based on what can be observed. A physical property which can be quantified and measured in numbers and units is called a physical quantity physical quantity. Length, mass, time, weight, temperature, density, speed, velocity, etc are physical quantities. Emotions, angers, feelings, appearances, etc which can not be quantized are not considered as physical quantities. In order to measure physical quantities some standard measures (or standards) must be defined on which everyone can agree. Standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement. We can measure things by compering them with the standards. Units of measurement provide standards for comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. A meter stick is an example of a standard. When something is measured with a meterstick, we compare their similar property with the meterstick. For example, if we measure a height of a pillar with a meterstick and found that height to be 6 meter then 6 is a number of times meterstick used in the measurement and meter is a unit (or length) of meterstick. This makes measurement easier and uniform.  There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether known as the base quantities. Their units are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. The diverse human history and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and CGS (centimeter gram second). The FPS system of units is also called British system and MKS system is also called a metric system. The metric system is a decimalized system of measurement developed in France in late century. Since the metric system is almost universally used, it is often referred to as the International System of Units and abbreviated SI. Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in table below.   The Systems of Units    Base Quantity  SI Units  SI Symbol    Mass  Kilogram  kg    Length  Meter  m    Time  Second  s    Amount of Substance  Mole  mol    Electric Current  Ampere  A    Temperature  Kelvin  K    Luminous Intensity  Candela  cd       Derived Units  Derived quantities are defined in terms of mathematical relation between the base quantities.     .

  "body": " Describing Motion     Distance: It is the length between the change in positions of an object. If is an initial position of the object and is a final position of that object then is the distance travelled by the object. It is a scalar quantity because it does not deal with the direction in which the object is travelling.It's unit is in SI system and in CGS system, and in FPS system.  Displacement: It is a direct distance between initial and final position of the object. It is the shortest path between initial and final positions of the object. It has the same unit as distance. It is a vector quantity because it has only one particular direction between the initial and position of the object. Let's understand by the example here, suppose you started travelling from initial point A and reached to point B by travelling 4 m distance along east. Now from point B you covered a distance of 3 m along north to reach to your final point C. So the direct distance between your initial position and final position is 5m given by Pythagoras theorem along north-east. . See the figure below as reference.  Displacement vector      Speed:The rate of change of position of an object is called a speed. It states that how fast the object is changing its position with respedt to time. In physics, the rate means with respect to time. It is also a scalar quantity. speed is represented by the letter, . If is an initial position and is the final position of the object then . It's unit is m\/s in SI system and cm\/s in CGS system, and ft\/s in FPS system.  Velocity: It is the speed of an object in particular direction. It is a vector quantity. It has the same unit as speed. It is also represented by the letter, .  Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity is called an acceleration. It states that how fast the velocity of an object is being changed. It is also a vector quantity. If is an initial velocity and is the final velocity of the object then the acceleration of the object is given by . It's unit is in SI system. If acceleration is positive then the object is speeding up, if it is negative then the object is slowing down, if it is zero then the object is either moving with uniform velocity or remains at rest. Note: Velocity is always in the same direction as the object is moving, but the acceleration is not.    Vector quantity carries two pieces of information, i.e. magnitude and direction. Vector is often represented by an arrow. A straight line with an arrowhead where the length of the line yields information about MAGNITUDE and the arrow indicates the direction . Mathematical operation is different for vectors than in scalars. It is not just the addition or subtraction of the numbers. We are not going to perform many vector mathematical operations here rather we try to understand addition and subtraction with some simple examples. Addition or subtraction of scalar quantities are just like adding or subtracting the numbers. In vector addition, the vectors are arranged in Head to Tail to find the sum of the vectors. In vector subtraction, the vector to be subtracted is flipped in direction and added to the other vector by arranging them in “Head to Tail” to find the sum of the vectors.     For example: in , the total distance travelled by the object is However, total displacement of the object is only along north-east directin as shown by the arrow AC. . Suppose water is flowing downstream with velocity 2 in a river where you are rowing your boat with 5 downstream. You can find that you are moving with 7 velocity (or speed) downstream. If you want to go upsteam then your velocity (or speed) would be 3 only. If you want to row accross the river then your velocity would be somewhere between 3 to 7 . . Suppose Aron is sweeming in a pool of 100 m wide. He took 5 laps, so he covers total of but his displacement is just zero. Remember one lap is one complete round of trip. However, if he just take a half lap then the distance covered is the same as displacement and are 100 m .      Equations of Motion  There are three equations of motion defined by the above terminologies which can help solve problems of motion. These eqations are obtained by manipulating average velocity and acceleration of the object.     Equations of motion in horizontal direction:   .  .  .    Equations of motion in vertical direction:   .  .  .     Here,  = acceleration due to gracvity, = height attains by the object, and = time taken by the object during its motion.  In vertical direction earth plays a vitol role in the acceleration of object motion. Earth pulls every thing downwards which causes acceleration due to gravity, negative. Accleration due to gravity is the acceleration of the object caused by the earth gravitational field. The value of . In vertical motion, we consider height as positive if going up (y-axis) and height as negative if coming down. But here, we are taking if the object is going vertically up, and for the object falling down. Such conventions allow us to assume h as always positive.  Note: The above equations only work for constant acceleration or acceleration due to gravity.    Free Fall  Objects moving under the influence of gravity only is called a free fall. This means gravity causes a change in the velocity of any object by 9.80 every second. So, drop any object and let it fall toward the ground: After 1s, the speed of the object is 9.80 . After 2s, the speed of the object is 19.6 . Etc. According to Galileo the velocity of a falling object is proportional to the length of time that the object has been falling. From the first equation of motion or,  as is a constant. Hence, the object is falling with higher velocity if it is falling for a long time or from a higher position. Since is constant near the planet all objects fall at the same rate. (Assuming there is no air resistance).    Projectile Motion  In normal day life, we encounter many examples where object moves along both horizontal and verticle direction together. Such type of motion is called projectile motion and the object moving in projectile motion is called a projectile. Hence, projectile is an object which has both horizontal as well as vertical motion. The path taken by the projectile is parabolic in nature. We are not dealing with mathematical operation related to projectile motion here but we try to understand the projectile motion by the following figure.  Projectile motion    Since gravity only acts on the verticle direction the horizontal velocity remains constant always in projectile motion.   "

  "body": " Force   Force is a push or pull. It is a vector quantity. Force is anything that produces a change in the state of motion or shape of an object. Action of force on an object can change the direction of motion or change the velocity of the object. Newton ( ) is an SI unit of force. There are four fundamental forces in nature. They are   Gravitational force or Force of Gravity: The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., Foece, = weight = . Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Weight: It is the force acting on an object due to gravitational acceleration. Weight is the effect of force of gravity on an object located at a particular point. One kg of mass has a weight of about 10 N ( ).    Electromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force exists due to the charge in the object. It is also a long range force but stronger than the gravitational force. It holds all the atoms and molecules together. We discuss this force later in another chapter.    Strong nucleur force: The strong nucleur force is a short range force and it exists only inside the nucleus. It binds all the nucleons together to have atomic existance. It is the strongest force in nature.    Weak nuclear force: The weak nucleur force is also short range force and only exists inside the nucleus. It is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is responsible for radioactivity of nucleous. The improper ratio of nucleons may cause the weak nuclear force to exist.     Physical contact of the object is not necessary to experience the fundamental forces. Hoverever, there are many other forces which only act on the object if they are in contact. They are called contact forces (or mechanical forces). Frictional force, normal force, tension, drag force, applied force, etc. are some contact forces.    Contact Forces   Friction: Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., or, . Where proportionality constant is called the coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces of contact. Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence.  In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in figure below. Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.  Surfaces of contact as seen from microscope      In real life frictional forces are almost always present. Remember the direction of frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion or the applied force. Friction is bad as it dissipates energy but friction is also good as it allows us to roll, turn, walk, and stop. Friction between two solids does not depend on the surface area in contact. Friction can happen, even between surfaces that are not solid such as air drag. Air resistance (drag) during free fall reduces the weight of the object. Air drag increases with the velocity of the object in free fall and when it becomes equal to the wight of the object net force acting on the object is zero and hence the object starts falling with the constant velocity called Terminal Velocity. Skydiving is a good example of terminal velocity.   Normal: This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension: This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the point of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. Any material has elastic property which helps it to restore its shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, spring force, where k is a spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant and is stretch made on spring.    Newton's Laws of Motion  Newton recognized that there are two kinds of motion they are uniform motion and accelerated motion. Uniform motion: the movement of an object traveling in a straight line at a constant speed (no acceleration). Accelerated motion: the movement of an object traveling under the influence of some source of acceleration. On that basis he defined three laws of motion called Newton's laws of motion.  Newton's first law is the definition of a force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in uniform motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied to it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion. The first law is also called a law of inertia . Inertia is an ability of an object to resist any changes in its motion. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change the state of rest or motion of an object. Mass: It is the amount of matter in contained in an object. It is also reposible for the force of gravity of the object. Some examples of I law: 1. When the bus driver abruptly applies the breaks, passengers tend to feel a momentary pull in the forward direction. The reason behind this jerk felt by the passengers sitting inside the bus is the law of inertia. Due to inertia, our upper body part continues to maintain a state of motion even after the bus stops, thereby pushing us in the forward direction. 2. A book kept on a bookshelf does not change its shape, size, or position until acted upon by an external force. 3. A runner is not able to stop himself right after crossing the finish line. He\/She tends to take time and cover a few meters of distance running beyond the finish line. This is because the inertia of motion resists a sudden termination of motion and compels the body to maintain its state of motion.  Newton's second law is the measurement of a force which states that the acceleration of the object is directly proportional to the applied force and takes the direction of that force. Newton's II law can be expressed as . Where is the mass of the object.  Newton's third law is the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Force always comes in pair. If an object A applies the action force on the object B then object B also applies the same amount of reaction force on the object A. These forces pair always act on two different objects. If one object exerts a force on a second object, then the second object exerts an equal but oppositely directed force on the first object. Mathematically,  Some examples: 1. Earth exerts force on you because you exert an equal and opposite force on earth. Here your force is your body weight and earth reaction force is a normal force. 2. When the rifle is fired it exerts a force on the bullet and the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the rifle. 3. You are able to sweem in water because you pushes water backwardly so apply the force on water and in reaction water also applies the same force on you just in opposite direction so you can sweem nicely.     Momentum  It is the quantity of motion contained in a body. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then its momentum, . Momentum (also called linear Momentum) is a product of mass and velocity of the object. Momentum is represented by , its SI unit is . Momentum is a vector quantity and its direction is along the velocity of the object.  From Newton's II law:    Here is called impulse and is called change in momentum. They are two different physical quantities but their magnitude remains the same. A force acting on an object for a certain time changes the momentum of that object, such change in momentum is called the Impulse. Impulse is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the average force. SI unit of impulse is .   A 300 kg horse running with 40 m\/s has a momentum of     When a 430 g soccer ball is kicked, the impact lasts for 0.04 s. Find the magnitude of force that is needed to fly off the ball at 8 m\/s.          Uniform Circular Motion  In uniform circular motion an object is moving at a constant speed (not velocity) on a circular path. For an object to be in uniform circular motion, there must be a net force acting on it. This force is called a centripetal force without this force nothing can move in a circular path. This net force is not a physical force of some kind actually some other forces must be there to act like a centripetel force. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle. The centripetal force, where is mass of the object, is speed of the object, and is radius of the circluar path. Because of necessary centripetal force, sometime we feel difficulty to steer our car around a sharp curve. The sharper the curve (i.e., the smaller the radius) the greater the centripetal force required to keep the car on the curved path. Cetripetal means to look towards the center, hence centripetal force is always acting towards the center of the path. Some examples: 1. We may have noticed that when the string breaks for a whirling stone. The stone flies off along the straight line tangential to the circular path. 2. When swinging a yo-yo around in a circle. The force generated by your arm puts the yo-yo itself in motion, and the tension on the string keeps it moving in a circular path as you twirl it. If the string were to break at any given point, the yo-yo would fly off in a direction that is tangent to the point on the circle that the yo-yo was at when the string broke centripetal force .    Newton's Law of Gravitation  Newton observed that when an object falls it was accelerated toward the earth. Since the cause of such acceleration is an unbalanced force, there must be a force pulling that object toward the earth. On this basis, he came up with an idea called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It states that any two masses in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, here, is an universal gravitational constant, and are the masses of two objects, and is the distance between the them.    Gravitational force between two Objects        Escape Velocity  Escape Velocity is the minimum velocity of an object with which it can be thrown out of the planet in such a way so that it can never come back. If a stone of mass m is thrown out from the earth with an escape velocity then it never fall back on the earth again. The escape velocity of earth is 11.2 km\/s.   "

  "title": "Work, Energy, and Power",
  "body": " Work, Energy, and Power    Work: If an object is displaced along the same direction as of the applied force then work is said to be done by the force. In the figure below force is pushing a block of mass along its direction for a distance of , then work done, by this force can be calculated by Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy from one object to another. The SI unit of work is Joule . In FPS system, , and in CGS system, are the work units.   Work done by the force      A horizontal force of moves a block of mass along a horizontal direction for a distance of . How much work is done by the force?         In figure (a) force is along the direction of horizontal and the block is also displaced along the same direction from point A to point B. In this case work done by the force is given by multiplication of force and the displacement . In this figure work done by the weight and normal force is zero as these forces are perpendicular to the displacement . However, in figure (b) work done by the slanted force is not zero but can be determined by the projected force which is not in the scope of this book. Remember for work to be done, foce and displacemenet must be non-zero. Work may be positive, negative, and zero. For example: work done by applied force along the direction of displacement is positive, work done by the frictional force is negative, and work done by the force perpendicular to the displacement is zero.  Energy: The capacity of doing work by a force is called an energy. It is also a scalar quantity and has the same unit as work. There are many forms of energy, but they all fall into two categories: potential energy and kinetic energy. These energies are also called a mechanical energy. Potential energy is the energy of position of the object. It is also a stored energy on the object which is equal to the work done on the object to bring it to this position. There are several forms of potential energy, including: gravitational potential energy, chemical energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, sound energy, heat energy, light energy, geothermal energy, etc. Chemical energy: It is energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. It is the energy that holds these particles together. Foods, biomass, petroleum, and natural gas are some examples of stored chemical energy. During photosynthesis, sunlight gives plants the energy they need to build complex chemical compounds. When these compounds are later broken down, the stored chemical energy is released as heat, light, motion, and sound. Elastic energy: It is an energy stored in objects by the application of a restoring force. Compressed springs and stretched rubber bands are examples of elastic energy. Nuclear energy: It is an energy stored in the nucleus of an atom that binds the nucleus together. The energy can be released when the nuclei are combined or split apart. Nuclear power plants split the nuclei of uranium atoms in a process called fission reaction fission reaction . The sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion reaction fusion reaction . In both the fission and fusion reactions, mass is converted into energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy principle. Gravitational potential energy: or Potential energy: It is the energy of position or place. It is the work done in lifting an object against gravity near the earth's surface. Gravitational Potential energy depends only on the distance from the ground, not on the object's motion. It is given by Here is the weight of the object and distance is the height at which the object is lifted. A rock resting at the top of a hill contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. In hydropower dam, water in the reservoir stored a gravitational potential energy. Kinetic energy: It is the energy of a body due to its motion. If a body of mass is moving with a velocity then kinetic energy is given by, .    Work-Energy Theorem  Let us apply Newton's II law into II equation of motion and rearange them.  Here, is final kinetic energy and is initial kinetic energy. Hence, is change in kinetic energy. Therefore, work done = change in kinetic energy. or This is known as work-energy theorem. Meaning the amount of work is done on a body is equal to its change in kinetic energy or vice a versa along the straight line.    A block of mass at rest is being pushed by an unknow force along the horizontal to bring it at 5 velocity.  How much work is done by the force?  If the body moves to a 2 m distance in this process. Find the value of unkown force.      Given: , , , .                 power  The rate of doing work is called power. It is also the rate at which the energy can be transfered. Power tell us that how fast the work has been done. Power can be expressed as  Its SI unit is Watt (w=j\/s).    Find the power a horse who does 7460 J of work in 10 second.      746 watt of power is also called 1 horsepower.       A car engine of 200kW power pushes the car to 25 m\/s. Find the thrust (force) produces by its engine.          "

  "title": "Conservation Principles",
  "body": " Conservation Principles   Conservation principles tell that some physical quantities remains constant through the change. Conservation principles began to play a central role in scientific theories from century. Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, Leibniz, and Newton established their approaches to physics on the the principle of inertia: the principle that tells a body will undergo uniform rectilinear motion unless it is disturbed. There are many conservation principles but here we are only discussing three of them.    Principle of Conservation of Energy  It states that in an isolated system, the total energy of the system is conserved. That is energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted from one form of energy to another. For example, when a stone falls from a roof its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy just before it hits the ground. When friction slows down the block to a stop, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. In case of mechanical energy, the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is conserved. That is, total energy at any moment of time is always same. Mechanical energy is due to the position and motion of the object. Therefore, In simple pendulum, when the bob is left from a displaced position it starts swinging to and fro motion due to conservation of energy. As its potential energy (PE) is converted into kinetic energy (KE) at the mean position acquire maximum velocity and keep moving otherside of mean position due to inertia. Once it reaches to another extrema it falls back again and retraces it path again and again. Click this link simple pendulum and try to understand conservation of energy principle. During the motion of a swinging pendulum, the energy is constantly changing from KE (kinetic energy) to PE (potential energy).  KE is MAX at lowest point,  KE is MIN at the top of the path ( ),  PE is MAX at top of path.      Conservation of Momentum  We have defined momentum in . Momentum, is also called a linear momentum as motion of the object is in straight line path. From Newton's II law we know that . If the force remains zero then, . This tells us that . Meaning, if total external force acting on a system is zero, then total linear momentum of the system, constant. This is known as principle of conservation of momentum. Hence, in the case of conservaiton of mementum, final momentum of the system is equal to the initial momentum of the system i.e.,  Newton's Cradle Click on the link to understand the conservation of linear momentum.    Collision  Momentum conservation is very useful in collision problems because the collision force is internal and hence does not change the total momentum. The impulse of a collision is the total momentum transferred during the collision, where a collision is an event where a very large force is exerted over a body for a very short interval of time, . During that interval magnitude of force is continuously changing. Therefore, the impulse of a force is the product of the average force and the time interval during the contact.   Collision provides a way to better understand the motion. A collision is an interaction between two objects that may or may not have made physical contact. In a collision the colliding objects experience a pair of forces acting on them. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object and these forces are equal in magnitude. These forces are Newton's III law pair. In an isolated system, total momentum is always conserved, hence such forces often increase the momentum of one object and decrease the momentum of the other. There are two kinds of collisions, elastic collision and inelastic collision. Elastic collision: objects are not deformed, e.g. bouncing balls, car's bumper, etc. Inelastic collision: objects become permanently deformed, e.g. auto accidents, throwing a mud on wall. Kinetic energy is only conserved in an elastic collission but not in an inelastic collision. However, momentum is conseved in both types of collisions. Total energy remains conserved in both types of collision.    Angular Momentum  Angular momentum is the momentum associated with a body in rotation about some axis. It is also a vector quantity. The direction of angular momentum is parallel to the axis of rotation. Spinning ball or rotating wheel has an angular momentum. Angular momentum is represented by, . Angular momentum is defined by Where is called moment of inertia and is called the rotational velocity of the object. Moment of inertia, tells us that how the mass of a body is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. Moment of Inertia, I: is an inability of a material to change its state of rotational motion. It is defined as here, is the object distance from the axis of rotation.    Torque  Just as force plays a role in moving object in linear motion, torque plays the same role in rotational an object about an axis. Torque in rotational motion is a linear analogue of force. Actually, torque is a turning effect of force which acts on a body in specific direction and at specific position. For example, if a force is applied at the center of mass of a body it will not produce any torque. But, if the same amount of force is acting off center then the body starts rotating about an axis. Just as force is a push or a pull, torque is a twist to an object around a specific axis. The magnitude of torque depends on the magnitude of applied force and the lever arm and ia given by     Conservation of Angular Momentum  Conservation of angular momentum tells that in rotaiton, initial angular momentum is always equal to final angular momentum of the body if no external torque is acting on it. That is If the moment of inertia of a rotaing body decreases then rotational velocity is going to increase. For example: 1. when ice skaters spin by pulling their arms inwards their rotational speed increase but their rotational speed decrease when they stretched their arms outwards. 2. A system of planets orbiting around a star has no net external torque acting, so its angular momentum is constant. Hence, when a planet travels along an elliptical orbit, its speed reduces when it is further away from the star and its speed increases as it approaches the star star-planet system . Look at the planetary motion of Nereid (Naptune's moon) in the law of orbits animation.   "

  "title": "Thermometers",
  "body": " Thermometers   As we know now that the most materials change their volume on heating. Such property of materials can be used to design thermometers to measure the temperature. There are varieties of thermometers in existence based on the phase (state) of materials is being used in thermometer. They are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. For example: If solid substance is used in thermometers, then the thermometers are called solid state thermometers. Platinum resistance thermometer, thermometer strip on the wall of aquarium, etc. are solid state thermometers. If liquid is used in a thermometer, then it is called a liquid thermometer. Mercury thermometer, alcohol thermometer, etc. are some examples. If gas is used then thermometer is called a gas thermometer. Hydrogen gas thermometer, hilium gas thermometer, nitrogen gas thermometer, etc. are some some examples.  Most common type of thermometer is liquid thermometer. In this thermometer, mercury or alcohol is filled in a narrow galss tube with metallic vessel at the bottom. Howerver, due to major developement in electronics, digitil thermometer is taking over the market to become more common thesedays. Here we are going to study temperature scale on the basis of liquid thermometer.  There are many types of thermometers exist in the practice, but we concentrate our study only on three basic types. They are Fahrenheit thermometer, Celsius (or Centigrade) thermometer, and Kelvin scale. Thermometers need calibration once they are made to provide correct temperature readings. To calibrate the thermometer the choice of unit and two reference points are taken. A centigrade (Celsius) thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as . In Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point (32 degree Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degree Fahrenheit) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as . Kelvin scale (usualy not called a thermometer) of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is units cooler than it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of Kelvin is equivalent to a temperature of . Traditionally, degree symbol is not assigned to the Kelvin scale. So a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin and not 300 degree Kelvin. Hence 300 Kelvin is abbreviated as . Conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below. The figure below is showing Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scale thermometers.  Thermometers    Fahrenheit     Celsius     Kelvin scale       Consider these thermometers are kept into three cups of coffey with same temperature. Where Celsius thermometer reads a temperature of C, Fahrenheit thermometer reads a temperature of F, and a Kelvin scale reads a temperature of K, then we can find their relationship as follows. Let's take one more set of unknown thermometer which has lower reference points marked as (for freezing point of water) and upper reference point marked as (for boiling point of water). When dipped into the identical cup of coffey, it reads the temeperature as . Hence we can note the temperature of coffey as . The comparision of all the thermometers reading we get the relation as  This relation is very helpful in converting one unit of temeprature into another one.    Convert into celsius temperature scale.    Here we use the following relationship      Kelvin Scale: The scale of thermometers depends upon the physical property (thermal expansion, electrical resistance, etc.) of the substance that is used in the thermometer. The physical property (e.g. thermal expansion) of materials varies differently at the different range of temperatures hence all these thermometers have a limited use. With the idea of constructing a temperature scale which should be independent on the material properties, Scottish physicist William Thomson, Baron Kelvin proposed on the basis of thermodynamics principles that the lowest possible temperature that could be achieved was , in 1848. This minimum temperature is the zero point on Kelvin scale and is known as absolute zero. Kelvin scale is a hypothetical (theoretical) thermometer scale and is also known as absolute scale. According to III law of thermodynamics, it is impossible to obtain absolute zero by any physical means. .    Quantity of Heat  Heat is a transfer of energy because of temperature difference. When an object gains or losses heat it either changes its temperature or its phase (state). A change in temperature is associated with changes in the average kinetic energy of the particles and a change in phase is associated with changes in the internal potential energy possessed by the object. In this section we will learn how to measure the quantity of heat gained or released by an object.    Specific Heat  Heat absorbing capacity of a material is known as specific heat capacity (or simply, specific heat ). It is a material property. Different materials absorb different amount of heat even for the same rise of temperature. For example, if you heat an identical iron ball and an aluminum ball in the same pot for the same time duration, then you would be surprised that the aluminum ball is colder than the iron ball. This is because the specific heat of iron is less than that of aluminum. In iron, more of the heat energy spent to increase the kinetic energy of its molecules than to increase the intermolecular potential energy. Hence, the the iron has a higher temperature. The quantity of total heat transfered to the body is given by the following formula: Where, stands for amount of heat required to change the temperature, stands for mass of the substance, stands for the specif heat capacity of the substance, and stands for the temperature change (i.e., ). Hence specific heat can be defined as the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 kg of the substance to . Its SI unit is . The greter the specific heat of the substance, the greater would be the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature per unit mass. The higher the specific heat of the substance, the higher amount of heat it can hold. The table below shows the specific heat of some common materials.   Specific heats of some common substances    Substance  Specific heat ( )    Water  1    Sand  0.16    iron  0.1    aluminum  0.22    Wood  0.42    Ice  0.5       How much heat in calorie is needed to heat 50 kg of water from to .    Given: m = 50 kg =50000 g, , , , and Q=?          Latent Heat  Heat absorbed or released by the material during phase change is called a latent heat. There is no temperature change during a phase change hence this energy is hidden from temperature scale. The energy dissipated or released during the phase change is in adjustment of particles potential energy in the bonds. Hence the amount of heat during phase change is given by Here is the amount of heat required to change the state or phase of the substance at change of state temperature, is the mass of the substance, and is the latent heat of the substance. Latent heat is also a material property. The latent (hidden) heat of fusion for water at is approximately 79.7 calories (334 J) per gram, and the latent heat of vaporization at is about 533 calories (2,230 joules) per gram.    Heat Transfer  It is a process of transfer heat from one location to another due to temperature difference. Heat can only flow from high temperature to low temperature. There are three processes involved in heat transfer. They are conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction: In this process heat is transferred through a body by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated, these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so, they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying particles do not physically move from their place rather they transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time one particle knock to another it passes some of its energy to next one and returns to its original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collision and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.  Conduction Process       Convection: In this process heat transfer occurs by the actual movement of fluid particles. Convection is heat transport due to bulk fluid motion. Convection happens in gases and liquids. When a fluid is heated, its molecules which are in contact with the hot surface get hot and expand. That is the fluid above a hot surface expands, becomes less dense, and rises. It carries the thermal energy along when rises up. The relatively cold fluid on the upper surface is heavier and sink down near the heat source. Hence a current of heat cycle develops in the convection process, called convection cycle.  Radiation: It is the process in which heat transfers without the need of intervening medium. Heat transfer occurs when electromagnetic waves emitted or absorbed. The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer than those of the visible spectrum. In atomic domain, the radiation is caused because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid are accelerating electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with different efficiencies. The good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. A perfect absorber is called a black body (such perfection is not found in nature, but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. A black body absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit surface area of a perfectly black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.    Entropy  Entropy is a mathematical concept explains some usefule phenomena of thermodynamics. The change in entropy tells whether the process can take place naturally or not. A natural tendency of systems is to lose order. Entropy is a measure of that disorderness. When sugar is dissolved in water it becomes more randomized, and will not reconstitute itself in the crystalline form again by itself, unless we apply heat energy from outside to the system and evaporate all water. When a hot and a cold body are put in contact to each other, heat energy begins to flow from the hot body to the cold body until they reach at thermal equilibrium (same Temperature). Heat will never move back to the other way. To move heat from a cold body to a hot body an external work must be done by an external source such as a heat pump. Entropy is a measure of the system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for useful work. The concept of entropy provides the direction of spontaneous change for many process. It tells us that which process is allowed and which is completely prohibited even if it can not violet the fundamental law of conservation of energy. A block of ice placed on a hot pan surely melts, while the pan goes cooler. Such a process is called irreversible because no slight change will cause the melted water to turn back into ice while the pan goes hotter. In contrast, a block of ice placed in an ice water bath will either thaw a little more or freeze a little more, depending on whether a small amount of heat is added to or taken out from the system. Such a process is reversible because only an infinitesimal amount of heat is needed to change its direction from progressive freezing to progressive thawing.   "

  "title": "Fluid",
  "body": " Fluid   Fluid is a material that can flow. Gasses and liquids are fluids. To study fluid it is easier to deal with fluid's volume, density, and pressure rather than its mass and weight. For example, we do transaction of any fluids in terms of their volume (liter) not in their mass (kg). Here, some terminilogies are being introduced to study fluid and its behavior.  Density: It is defined as a mass per unit volume of the fluid. It is a scalar quantity.  Its unit is in SI system, or in cgs system, and in fps system. Any two objects of identical volume the heavier one has higher density than the other. Take two marbles of same size but one is a lead marble and another is a glass marble. Which one do you feel heavier, has the higher density.    Calculate the mass of water in a container of size 25 cm long, 15 cm wide and is filled with water up to 10 cm high. If the density of water is .    The volume of water, Hence, the mass of water in the container is given by .     Pressure: It is defined as a force per unit area of the surface. Force must be acting perpendicularly on the surface. Pressure defines how hard the object is pushing something in or out. It is a scalar quantity.  Its unit is or pascal (Pa) in SI system. In FPS system of unit it is measured in which means pounds per square inch. Many units of pressure are still in practice such as torr, bar, mm of Hg., atm., etc. 1 atm is one atmospheric preesure,     How much pressure is applied on the ground by a girl of 50 kg if she is balancing herself by standing on her one shoe heel of area .    The force exerted by the girl on ground is equal to her weight, and, Surface area = Hence, the pressure on the ground is given by .       Archimedes' Principle  When an object is placed in a fluid it experiences an upthrust force called a buoyant force. It is arising due to changes of pressure inside fluid. This phenomenon is known as Archimedes' principle. It states that when a body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced. That is, a buoyant force ( ) = weight of displaced fluid ( ). Archimedes' principle tells whether the object floats or sinks in the fluid. If weight of the object is greater than the buoyany force, it sinks. If its weight is equal to the buoyant force, it submerges inside the fluid but does not sink. If its weight is less than the buoyant force then it floats on the surface of liquid.   Buoyant force     In this case, volume of displaced liquid is equal to the volume of submerged portion of the object. On this basis, we can tell that if the density of an object is greater than that of fluid, it sinks. If object density is equal to the density of fluid, then object submerges. If object density is less than the density of fluid, then object floats. To make iron ship not to sink in water, it is made with wide surface area and its body is like a hollow shell, so that the density of entire ship is less than the density of water.    Kinetic Theory of Gases  The nature of gas is completely different than solids and liquids. Gas tskes up the entire volume of the container and can be compressed easily. Gas pressure increase or decrease as the temperature of the container change. It diffuses (or leaks out) to air if the container is left open. On such experiences, Kinetic theory of gas is developed to explain the nature of heat and the motion of particles associated with heat energy. According to this theory, gas is composed of large number of very tiny particles called molecules. These molecules are always in random motion with all possible directions and speeds which increases with the increase of temperature. In gases, the molecules are very far away from each other than in solids and liquids and have negligibly small force of attraction between them. Hence they can move freely anywhere within the available space. This explains why a gas has no definite shape and size. To understand the more general behavior of gases kinetic theory of ideal gases is postulated as  All gases are made up of molecules. Molecules are identical, rigid, and perfectly elastic moving in random directions with all possible velocities.  The molecules are very far away from each other but they collide with each other and with walls of the container.  All the collisions are elastic, but time spent during each collision is negligibly small compared to the time spent between the collisions.  Molecules do not interact with each other (no intermolecular force of attraction) except during a collision.  The average kinetic energy of the molecules of any gas depends only on the temperature.  Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas of negligible molecular size and have no interactions among their molecules. In practice, a very dilute gas with extremely large volume of container space can be considered as an ideal gas. Remember the real gas molecules has definite size and may interact with each other. Hence this postulates are just a very simplified model to understand gas laws and need modification for real gas behaviors. To experience the general behavior of gas please play with simultion link here. gas laws     The Gas Laws  From the experience of factors affecting the gas pressure ideal gas law is defined below. Ideal Gas Law or also called equation of state. It is found that the pressure, of the gas is directly proportional to number of molecules, and the absolute temeperature, and inversely proportional to the volume, V of of the gas. That is where is proportionality constant. Therefore For mole of gas, the above equition turns into this equation is know as equation of state. Here, is number of mole of gas in a container and is universal gas constant.  If T is constant in this equation then it is called Boyle's Law  If is constant in this equation then it is called Charle's Law     "

  "title": "Charges",
  "body": " Charges   Charge is an entity which provides an electric property of the matter. Charge is of two types, positive charge and negative charge. Electrons in an atom consist of negative charge and protons of the atom consist of positve positive charge. Similar kinds of charges always repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. Charge is a scalar physical quantity. Charge is conserved meaning charge can neither be created nor be destroyed; it can only be transferred from one place to another or from one object to another. The net charge on any system is always constant. All matter is composed of atoms and atoms are composed of three elementary particles, called electrons, protons, and neutrons. Charge is also quantized meaning charge always comes in discrete amounts, and the smallest possible amount of charge that any object could have is . This is the amount of charge on one electron. Whenever an atom gains or loses an electron, atom is ionized. The ionized atom is always charged. An ion is simply an atom with a net charge. The ion can be positive or negative. If is the total negative charge on any object and is the charge of electron, then total number of electron, n on that object can be find using the following equation. where     A glass is rubbed vigorosly with a fur and found that it gained of charge. Calculate how many electrons has the glass rod lost?        electrons.        Coulomb's Law  The force of attraction or repulsion between any two point charges is directly proportional to the product of these charges and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them. The direction of force is always acting along the line joining these two point charges. If is a force acting on the charges and , and is a distance between the two charges (see figure below) then from Coulumb's law Here, Coulomb's constant, . This law only works for two point charges at rest. Hence, the Coulomb's law is also known as law of electrostatic force on   Coulomb's force    unlike charges     like charges        If the distance between an electron and a proton in a hydrogen atom is . Find the electrostatic force acting btween the electron and the proton.        . Negative sign explains that the force is attractive in nature.        Electric Field  The space around a charge where force of attraction or repulsion can be experienced by any other charged particle is called an electric field. Electric field is also known as electrostatic field intensity. It is an inherent property of a charge. An electric field is produced by a charge and is experienced by another charge. It is an electric field of a charge which tells another charge how to move in the space if it is free to do so. Electric field is a force acting on a unit charge and is a vector quantity. Electric field lines: It is an imaginary path of a unit positive charge in an electric field. Electric field lines are aslo known as electric lines of force. It is always pointed radially outward for a positve charge and radially inward for a negative charge as shown in figure .   Electric Lines of Force    due to a +ve charge     due to a -ve charge     due to two unlike charges     due to two like +ve charges        Materials on Electrical Point of View  On the basis of electrical behavior there are four types of materials exist in nature they are conductor, insulator, semiconductors, and superconductors.   Conductor: It is a material where charge carriers (electrons or ions) are free to move within it. Copper, aluminum, gold, mercury, iron, water-salt solution, etc. are few examples of conductors. In a conductor outermost electrons of an atom are loosely bounded with its nucleus and hence are free to move throughout the material even at very low temperature. The random motion of electrons causes zero net electric current in a conductor unless an external electric field is applied on it. Insulator: It is a material where electrons are tightly bounded with their atom and can not move very easily. Plastics, glass, rubber, wood, porcelain, etc. are few examples of insulators. Check the simulation link conductor & insulator  Semiconductor: It is a material having properties between insulator and conductor. Silicon and germanium are good example of it. At low temperature this material behaves as an insulator and at high temperature it behaves as a conductor. The conductivity of semiconductor can be increased enormously by doping of this material with a very small amount of suitable dopants such as boron, phosphorous, or arsenic. Superconductor: It is a material which transfers electrons from one atom to another throughout the material without any resistance. No loss of energy can be observed when material conduct electricity. Mercury shows superconducting nature at temperature below 4 Kelvin.   "

  "title": "Electricity",
  "body": " Electricity   It is a branch of physics which deals with the motion of charges in a conductor. When charge flows from one place to another, an electrical current is formed. An electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge. If a net charge passes through any conductor in time , then the electric current is given by Its unit is Ampere (A). One ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity and its conventional direction is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In conductor, current flows solely due to motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electrons flow. From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, the current is said to be direct current, or DC current. It is commonly used in devices electronic devices like cell phones and computers. If the direction of motion of charges reverses periodically, the current is known as an alternating current, or AC current. It is commonly used in the electrical power systems that supply to homes and commercial applications. AC current goes from positive to negative in a cycle, while DC current is always in the same direction. Current can only exist between two points of different potential (voltage) connected by a conductor and can only exist whenever a conductive path with no breaks is provided. DC & AC Flow of charges in DC current is similar to flowing water, but in AC current, charges do not go any where rather they are oscillating about the mean position at their respective position. Check the simulation link to visualize DC and AC current. DC & AC AC is more efficient to transmit over long distances than DC. This is the reason why AC is used in power transmission and distribution as well as in motors and other equipment. It is also used in many household appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. AC can also be easily transformed to different voltages using a transformer, while this is not easy to achieve with DC. DC voltage can be stored in a device called battery, while AC voltage can not be stored.    Electric Potential (Voltage)  Electric potential, also known as voltage, is a measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge in an electric field. That is, or, . It is the amount of work required to move a unit positive charge from one point to another in an electric field. The unit of electric potential is the volt (V). A higher electric potential difference between two points indicates a greater amount of energy required to move a unit charge between those points. Voltage can be think of like a \"push\" for a charge. The higher the voltage, the more \"push\" the charge experience to flow through wires. Charge can only flow from high potential(voltage) to low potential (voltage). It's important to note that just like water can be dangerous if not handled properly, electricity can also be dangerous if not handled with care.    Ohm's Law  Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the two ends of the conductor, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. It can be mathematically expressed as or, here I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance of the conductor. Resistance: is a restriction imposed by a conductor on the motion of a current. Motion of charge carriers (electrons) are not very smooth in a conductor as they bump onto the other electrons and positive charge residual atoms during their motion. Such restrictions in flow of electrons is measured as a resistance of a conductor in current flow. It is denoted by and its unit is Ohms ( ). Electrical Power: It is the measure of energy transferred or consumed per unit time i.e.,   Hence power is also defined as the product of current and voltage. Its unit is Watts (W). One watt means consuming the one joule of energy every second.  Now from Ohm's law,  Hence, the power of electrical circuit is given as     Electrical Shock: According to Ohm's law if resistance of the conductor is low then the higher current can flow through it. High current can be deadly. Actually, a “voltage” does not go “into” your body rather current can pass through it when charges flow toward a lower potential. In order to get electric shock atleast of current must pass through our body. In dry condition, human body has a resistance of about , so to have current flowing through our body we need to touch the voltage source of about , as shown in the calculation below. In wet condition, human body resistance becomes only , so to get current through our body we need to touch the voltage source of about .    Electrical Circuits  Electrical circuit is a network of electrical elements (such as resistance (bulb), battery, conductor, switch, etc.) through which current can flow in a closed path. Electrical circuits can be of two types,  Series Circuit: in this type of circuits all the electrical components are connected one after another in such a way that the same current flows through each components as shown in figuer below. An example of a series circuit is a string of Christmas lights, where each bulb is connected to the next in a line. If one bulb burns out, the entire circuit is broken and none of the lights will turn on.  Series circuit      Parallel Circuit: in this type of circuits all the electrical components are connected side by side in such a way that the voltage across each component is the same as shown in figuer below. An example of a parallel circuit is a house's electrical system, where different appliances are connected to the same circuit but have their own separate paths for current to flow through. If one path is broken or one appliance stops working, it doesn't affect the other appliances or the overall circuit.  Parallel circuit       series & parallel circuit To change from series to parallel circuit, Please hold the bulb and rotate the circuit in the simulation.   "

  "title": "Magnetism",
  "body": " Magnetism   It is a branch of physics which deals with magnets and magnetic properties of materials. It defines the magnetic behavior of material which is associated with the motion of electric charge. The motion of charges in a conductor or in space gives rise to magnetic fields and magnetism is a result of magnetic fields. The word ”magnet” is taken from Latin word µαγνήτης λίθoς meaning stones from magnesia. ”Magnetis [líthos]” is sources of lodestones found in Manisa, Turkey. Magnetism is caused by moving charges and is experienced by moving charges. It is a phenomenon of materials by which they attract or repel other materials. The motion of an electron in an orbit around a nucleus or its spin on an axis produces a magnetic field.  The most familiar magnet is a bar magnet. It is a piece of iron bar that has been magnetized. However, other shape of magnets are also available these days such as disk magnet, horseshoe magnet, ring magnet, etc.  Magnets of different shapes    In any magnet, there are two regions (normally at the ends or faces) where magnetic strength is very strong. These stronger regions are called magnetic poles. One is designted as north pole, N and the other as south pole, S . This is because When a magnet is hanged by a thread and allowed to rotate freely, it will align itself in a north-south direction, due to the earth's magnetic field. The north end of the magnet will point towards the Earth's geographic north pole and the south end towards the Earth's geographic south pole. This is why north pole is also known as north seeking pole and the south pole as south seeking pole . The magnet also aligns at an angle itself with the earth's horizontal plane. This angle is known as the angle of dip or inclination , it varies depending on the location on the earth surface. The magnet also aligns itseld at an angle from the true north-south direction. This angle is known as magnetic declinaiton . The magnetic declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north direction. Magnetic north is the direction indicated by a compass, and true north is the direction of the Earth's geographic north pole. This angle can vary depending on location and time. earth as a magnet   Like poles of magnet repel and unlike poles attract. North and south poles always exist in pairs (there are no magnetic monopoles in nature), so if one were to split a permanent magnet in half, two smaller magnets would be created, each with a north pole and south pole. Even if one cuts a magnet into pieces all the way down to a single atom they still get a N pole and a S pole because of orbiting electron in the atom. Just like a graviational force both electric and magnetic forces can act on the objects without being in direct contact.  Magnet        Electromagnetism  Orsted discovered that electric currents can produce magnetic fields and Faraday discovered that magnetic fields can be used to induce electric currents in a circuit. A moving electrical charge also generates a magnetic field just as changing magnetic field induces current in a conductor. In fact, a traditional magnet is the result of individual motion of electrons within the atoms of the magnet. These atoms are so aligned that magnetic field procduced by their electrons are pointed along a uniform direction giving rise to a mangetic field of the magnet. In non-magnetic materials, the electrons move in such a way that the individual magnetic fields point in different directions, so they cancel each other out and the net magnetic field generated is negligible. In normal condition, magnetic fields of the magnetic material are distributed in groups of small region, called domain and magnetic fields of each domain are oriented in different directions to cancel each other effect. This is why iron is just a piece of metal bar unless it is magnetized.  Electromagnetism is considered as the interaction of electric and magnetic effects. It tells that  the moving charges (current) give rise to magnetic fields, current produce magnetic field  and changing magnetic field gives rise to electric current magnetic field generating current  . The direction of the magnetic field produced by a current in wire can be determinded using right hand thumb rule . If fingers of right hand is curl along the direction of current moving then thumb is pointed along the direction of magnetic field produced by the current. In contrary, if thumb is pointed along the direction of current then curled fingers show the direction of magnetic field generated around the wire.  Right Hand Thumb Rule        Electromagnet  An electromagnet typically consists of a coil of wire, often wrapped around a ferromagnetic core, such as iron. When an electric current is passed through the coil, it creates a magnetic field around the core. This magnetic field can be used to attract or repel ferromagnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the coil. Electromagnets are used in a wide range of applications, including electric motors, generators, and audio speakers. They can also be used to create temporary or adjustable magnetic fields, making them useful in scientific and industrial settings. electromagnet     Transformer  Transformer is an electrical appliance which convert large current at low voltage to low current at high voltage, and vice versa. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to transform electrical energy from one circuit to another one. An AC current is needed to operate transformer. In AC current direction of current is keep changing which changes the magnetic field generated in the primary coil of transformer. Such changing magnetic field induces the current in the secondary coil of transformer. A typical transformer consists of a two or more coils of insulated wire wound on a laminated iron core. An alternating (AC) voltage which is to be reduced or increased is connected to the coil, called the primary coil or input coil. This coil magnetizes the iron core. A voltage is then induced in the other coil, called the secondary or output coil. The change of voltage (or voltage ratio) between the primary and secondary depends on the turns ratio of their two coils.   Schematic of Transformer    There are two types of transformer on the basis of their operation. If the number of turns in primary coil is less than that at secondary then it is called a step-up transformer and if number of turns in primary is grater than that in secondary then it is called a step-down transformer. Transformer transfers an electrical power from primary coil to secondary coil hence it also obeys the principle of conservation of energy. That is,  see equation for electrical power.   "

  "title": "Wave and its Properties",
  "body": " Wave and its Properties   When a stone is thrown in a quiet pond a number of nice circular rings, called ripples emerge on the surface of water which grow gently and move across the pond in a concentric pattern. These growing ripples are called a wave which carries energy from the point of stone thrown to the edge of a pond. Hence a wave can be defined as a disturbance in space that can carry energy from one location to another. A wave creates in a medium when a medium is trying to regain its equilibrium state (normal position). When a stone is thrown it transfers its energy to the surface of water due to which water layer stretches downwards till stone dips down that layer of water. When stone leaves the water layer, water wants to recover its original position to maintain equilibrium due to surface tension but as it reaches to the original position it keeps raising upward because of inertia and stretches the water surface again till it reaches the maximum height. Now due to surface tension this layer of water gets pulled down again and starts falling down below the equilibrium position due to inertia such procedure is the cause of waves (disturbances) on water. Energy propagates two ways in water one way is due to vertical up and down motion of water surface and another way is a back and forth motion of water molecules inside the water. Similar to concentric circles on water surface energy transmitted in space in the form of concentric spheres. Figure below ripples in wave shows the same disturbances traveling away from the center as a series of successive wavefronts labeled crests and troughs. A wavefront is a locus of points along which all phases and displacements are identical. The solid circles depict the outward-moving wave crests; the dashed circles represent wave troughs. Adjacent crests are always a wavelength apart, as are the adjacent troughs.  Waves    Ripples on Water Surface     Schematics of ripples       In short, wave is a wiggles in time and space. On the basis of particle motion relative to the direction of energy propagation there are two forms of waves.  Longitudinal wave, and  Transverse wave.  In longitudinal wave the medium particles vibrate parallel to the motion of the energy. Longitudinal waves are also called pressure waves. As a layer of one part of a medium creates pressure on the other part of the medium. Sound waves in any medium, waves propagating along spring are an example of such wave. In transverse wave the medium particles vibrate perpendicular to the motion of the energy propagation. Movement of a wave through a solid object like a stretched rope or a trampoline is an example of such wave.  On the basis of requirements of medium to propagate energy there are two types of waves.  Mechanical wave, and  Electromagnetic wave.  Mechanical waves require material medium to propagate such as sound waves, water waves, string waves, seismic waves, etc. Electromagnetic waves on the other hand do not need any medium but can propagate both in vacuum and in a medium, such as light waves, heat waves, radio waves, etc. Electromagnetic (em) waves are transverse in nature where electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of energy propagatation. Longitudinal waves occur when a spring is fixed at one end and pulled back and forth by the other end as shown in figure below. Transverse waves occur when a spring or string is fixed at one end and wiggled up and down by the other end as shown in figure below. Both the waves can be easily described by a transverse nature as they are periodic in nature. The crest is the highest point on a wave. The trough is the valley between two waves, is the lowest point. The wavelength, is the distance, either between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. It is the length of one complete wave. The amplitude, is the peak value (either positive or negative) of a wave. The distance from the undisturbed level (equilibrium position) to the trough or crest. The compression is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are crowded together. The rarefaction is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are spread apart. The wavelength is the distance from compression to compression or rarefaction to rarefaction in a pressure (longitudinal) wave. The frequency, is a number of complete waves per second.  Representation of waves    Longitudinal wave     Transverse wave     If is a time period to generate one complete wave then . Its unit is Hertz (Hz), i.e. cycles per second.  Wave speed, is telling how fast the information propogates. Suppose wave covers (information reaches) a distance in time , then from equation , we have Therefore, using equation    There is a third kind of new wave that has just been discovered, known as a gravitaional wave. It is a disturbance in spacetime and can pass through anything undisturbed. It travels with the velocity of light. It stretches and squashes the spacetime during propagation.   Resonance: It is a condition at which amplitude of vibration of an object becomes maximum once the object is subjected to a force with a frequency equal to its natural frequency. Resonance is a frequency at which standing waves are produced. The natural frequencies of a musical instrument are reffered as the harmonics of the instrument.    Sound  Sound is a longitudinal wave that can be produced by vibration. The speed at which sound waves travel through a medium depends on the density and stiffness of the medium, whether condition, temperature, moisture, etc. It is a mechanical wave and creates pressure on a layer of medium when propagates, hence it is also called a pressure wave. Sound wave is longitudinal in nature. When such energy reaches to our eardrum it begins vibrating and we get sensation of hearing. The physical character of sound depends upon the listener's audible perception. The physical quantity that defines the loudness is amplitude (sound pressure) of the wave and the quantity that defines the timbre (or quality) of sound is a frequency . A sound of frequency to is audible to healthy human ear. Loudness increases with the increase of pressure amplitude at a given frequency. Loudness (or Intensity level) is a sound energy received by a unit area of listener's eardrum (or detector) in unit time. Loudness is a listener's perception. Intensity is an energy carried by a wave per unit area per unit time. Intensity is a property of sound producing device. Loudness is an intensity received by a listener.  More content.    Reverberation and Echo  Echo and reverberation are two distinct phenomenon of sound waves which occur due to its reflection from any surfaces. Sound endures in our brain for longer than 0.1 second. If sound is reflected from any surface reaches to our ear within 0.1 second of the initial sound, then it seems that the sound is prolonged. The reception of reflected sound within 0.1 second causes the reverberation(or) the prolonging of a sound effect. The speed of sound in air is about at room temperature. If the wall of a room is meter away from the source of sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s Hence, causing a prolonged sound effect, called a reverberation . Echoes are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original sound was heard, then echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the original sound wave as in reverberation.    Doppler Effect  The Doppler effect is the change in perceived frequency of a source due to the relative motion between the source and the receiver. It applies to all sorts of waves. Doppler effect can be experienced as the change in pitch (or frequency) received. When the ambulence is approaching, the pitch of siren is getting higher than the actual frequency of siren. When the ambulence passes by, the frequency sounds the same as the actual emitted frequency and when the ambulance is moving away, the pitch is getting lower than the actual emitted frequency. When the source of the waves is coming towards the observer, observer receives more waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves bunch together for the observer giving impression for the decrease of wavelength and causing an increase in the frequency. Conversely, if the source of waves is going away from the observer, observer receives less waves every second compared to being at rest. That is waves ”spread out” for the observer giving impression for the increase of wavelength and causing a decrease in the frequency. Doppler effect    "

  "title": "Light",
  "body": " Light   Light is a form of energy. It excites the sensation of vision when strikes the eye retina. To see things around having only eye is not very important but also the presence of light is very important. A blind person can not see anything even if the room is full of light just as a normal person can not see anything if room is completely dark. Light coming from an object when falls on the surface of eye retina we can see that object. Even though light helps us see things around light itself is invisible. However, we divide light into two categories, the visible light and the invisible light. It is not because we can or can not see the light rather it is based on the sensation of vision produced by these light in our eye. Light which can help sensation of vision is called a visible light and that which which can not stimulate the sensation of vision is called an invisble light. Light is an electromagnetic radiation which consists of the ranges of waves from gamma rays to radio waves. The so called visible light is a very small portion of an electromagnetic radiation.  Electromagnetic Spectrum NASA       Geometrical Optics  Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called a luminous (or self-luminous) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb, fireflies, etc. Objects that do not emit but reflect light are known as non-luminous objects such as moon, planets, wood, plastics, metals, etc.  Light travels in straight lines until it encounters with some obstacle. Hence we can approximate light by considering it as a ray. The physics which deals with light in the form of a ray is called geometrical optics. Light bents from its straight path when it strikes on the surface of another medium such as in reflection and refraction. When light strikes on the surface of material three phenomena happen. That is,  light reflects from the material  light transmitts throgh the material, and  light is absorbed by the the material.      Reflection of Light  When light travels in one medium strikes onto the surface of another medium it bounces off to the same medium is known as reflection. It is the reflection which helps us to see our image in the mirror. There are two types of reflection, specular (regular) reflection and diffuse (irregular) reflection. Both types of reflection obey the laws of reflection. Reflection of Light    Laws of Reflection:    The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the point of incident all lie in the same plane.    The second law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.   Consider a light ray, AO is incident on a smooth surface, like morror at an angle and bounces off, then from law of reflection      Reflection of light     Regular reflection     Irregular reflection         Refraction of Light  The phenomenon of bending of light ray as it goes from one medium to another is called a refraction. The velocity of light depends on the medium it is propagating which causes the refraction. The measure of an obstacle that a medium impose on the velocity of light is known as refractive index of that medium. Refraction of Light      Refraction of light     Bent Pencil         Dispersion of Light  The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent colors is known as dispersion. When white light passes through a prism it splitted into seven colors due to dispersion of light. The images of this color patterns formed on a screen is called a spectrum. The spectrum consists of a visible and invisible regions of light. The principal colors of light in the visible spectrum are given as \"VIBGYOR\" (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red). The deviation occurred in violet light is maximum and that for red light is minimum as shown in figure . In the invisible regions, the spectrum of wavelengths shorter than violet is called an ultraviolet light and that for longer than red is called an infrared light. The color of light is dependent on its wavelength, . Here is a list of wavelengths of visible light   Dispersion of light     Rainbow is formed when sunlight is dispersed by rain droplets which are suspended in air. When sunlight enters the raindrop it refracts then it undergoes dispersion and total internal reflection from the rear end of the droplet surface and again refracted out in the atmosphere and that's how we see a rainbow. So all the given process i.e total internal reflection, refraction, and dispersion take place in the rainbow formation as shown in figure . Scattering of light doesn't take place in the process of formation of a rainbow.  Dispersion of light      Scattering of Light  It is a phenomenon of redirected light in different directions when it interacts with small particles or irregular surfaces. This can cause the light to appear hazy or dispersed. Due to scattering sky looks bluish as blue colors scattered more in sky than any other colors from the visible spectrum of light. In fact, violet light scattered more than blue but our eyes are more sensitive o blue color than violet light hence blue colors are much more prevailed than others in sky. At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel longer distance in the atmosphere which causes most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths to scatter in the sky and only red color can reach to our eyes hence the sun appears reddish in color.

  "title": "Atoms and Nucleus",
  "body": " Atoms and Nucleus   An atom is the basic unit of matter and the defining structure of elements. The term \"atom\" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. However, we now know that atoms are made up of smaller particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element the atom is. Atoms form molecules through chemical bonds and make up all matter in the universe. They play a crucial role in many processes, such as chemical reactions, combustion, and the transmission of signals in living organisms. Understanding the properties of atoms and how they interact with each other is essential for fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. The study of atoms is called atomic physics. It wasn't until the 19th century that the idea of atoms gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron and showed that atoms were made up of negatively charged particles. Then, in 1909, Ernest Rutherford demonstrated that atoms also contained a positive nucleus. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model for the atomic structure that explained the periodic table of elements and the spectra of light emitted by atoms. Throughout the 20th century, scientists continued to study atoms and their components, leading to the development of quantum mechanics and a deeper understanding of atomic structure and behavior. This research has numerous applications in fields such as energy production, electronics, and medicine.  The Nucleus of an atom refers to the central, positively charged part of an atom that contains protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons). The number of protons in the nucleus, known as the atomic number, determines the element to which the atom belongs. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons in orbital shells. The properties of an element are determined by the arrangement of its electrons and its atomic number. The nucleus of an atom is very small compared to the overall size of the atom, but contains most of the atom's mass. The strong force, also known as the nuclear force, holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. The nucleus can undergo various types of changes, such as fusion (combining of two nuclei) or fission (splitting of a nucleus). The study of atomic nuclei is called nuclear physics. The isotopes of an element are atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons in their nucleus.   "
