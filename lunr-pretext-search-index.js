  "title": "Not just that..",
  "body": " Not just that..  Learning skills by memorization cannot work efficiently in learning physical sciences. It is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into ten chapters that covers the syllabus of physical science at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. The topics in this book have been carefully selected to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of science and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted. - Author ( skarna@unionky.edu )  "

  "title": "Scientific Methods",
  "body": " Scientific Methods   Scientific method is a series of logical steps followed by the investigators in conducting experimentation, making observation, and formulating hypothesis to solve or answer some specific questions about the natural world. The process is not linear but circular. Any question that cannot be proven or disproven through testing, cannot be included in scientific method. The steps of the scientific method are as follows:  Observation: we observe something that is interested to us to gather knowledge through our senses or collecting information using scientific instruments. For example, Follow the night sky throughout the year, where we can see some patterns of stars march in locked step accross the sky and some of the other bright objects are not.  Question: we formulate a question about what we have observed. For example, what are those bright objects in the sky that do not follow the locked step marching as other stars?  Hypothesis: we make a hypothesis. It is an idea that is suggested as an explanation for our observation to answer the question. It is important to note that a hypothesis must be testable. It means hypothesis must either be supported or falsified by your experiment. For example, we think that these are the wandering objects in the sky.  Experiment: we design and conduct an experiment that will test our hypothesis. Here we include and identify a controlled variable or dependent variable in our procedure that allow us to test a single variable in an experiment because they are unchanged. For example, look the relative motion between these objects and other stars in the sky. The stars positions are fixed and they do not have relative motion between them. However, the wandering objects move completely independtly in the sky.  Results: we report what happened in the experiment. For example, After careful experimentation and formulation we find that these wandering objects are not stars rather they are the same objects like our earth.  Conclusion: Here we conclude our results that has come from the data analysis. This section tells whether the experiment supported or rejected our hypothesis? If your hypothesis was supported, great. If not, repeat the experiment or think of ways to improve your procedure. For example, in our sky observation and experimentation we found that our hypothes was supported by the experiment and we gave the name of wandering objects as \"Planets\"      Significant Figures   Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be 287.5 cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the first digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) he\/she could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the first digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter how accuratly you measure things, there is always some inaccuracy in every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.    1000 has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000. : notice that ”point” after the zero! This has four significant digits, because the decimal point tells us that the measurement was made to the nearest unit, so the zero is not just a placeholder.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the ”.0” tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then If it had four sig. fig. then 200.0 is sufficient.    Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:  All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.  All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.  Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number ”540” there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.  Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.  Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; 1.32 × 106 has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped. If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it. If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded. If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error.    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don’t round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don’t round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).     Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits:   To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to ”place” the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.     Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits:   For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is ”odd” and followed by a ”5”, then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits.  For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is ”even” and followed by a ”5”, then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.        Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures    Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as:  Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures as      Science and Religion  Science is a study of understanding the natural phenomena based on observation and experimental evidence acquired by scientific method. It is always skeptical and never correct to 100%.  Religion on the other hand is understanding the purpose, source, and meaning of our world based on faith. Many principles are accepted without asking any question.   "

  "title": "Ancient Observations",
  "body": " Ancient Observations     Solar System   Our Solar System     We have been observing sky since the begining of human history. It seems that the sun is revolving around the earth. On such observation the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD came up with the idea of Geocentric Theory in which unmoving earth is at the center of the universe and the sun is revolving around it. He was able to predict fairly accurate positions of celectial objects and his theory was the longest ever (about 2500 years) accepted theory of universe. However, his theory was not able to explain Retrograde Motion correctly.    Retrograde Motion  Sometimes celestial objects such as some planets appear to move backwardly in their orbit around the sun as shown in the animation below. Please click on start button in the animation. In the animation retrograde motion is shown for the planet \"Mars\". The projection of mars in the sky is shown by the background stars. We notice that when mars reaches to certain positions it looks suddenly moving backward as seen from the earth and after some time in the year it again starts moving forward in its orbit around the sun. Such an apparent reverse motion of the planets is called retrograde motion. Ptolmy's geocentric theory was not able to explain this event very cleary. So in 1543, Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus publish revised but completly radical theory called Heliocentric Theory . In this theory the unmovable sun at the center of the universe and all the planets are moving around it in the specific oribit. This theory was able to solve almost all the puzzles of the time. In heliocentric model of the solar system Copernicus proposed that the Earth has three distinct motions: a daily axial rotation, an annual rotation about the Sun, and a precessional motion of its axis.    Units and Measurements  Physics endeavors to decipher natural laws. In order to describe a natural law (or physical law) a measurement of varieties of physical quantities are essential. Measurement is a process that uses numbers and units to describe a physical quantity based on what can be observed. A physical property which can be quantified and measured in numbers is called a physical quantity. Length, mass, time, weight, temperature, density, speed, velocity, etc are physical quantities. Emotions, angers, feelings, appearances, etc which can not be quantized are not considered as physical quantities. In order to measure physical quantities some standard measures (or standards) must be defined on which everyone can agree. Standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement. We can measure things by compering them with the standards. Units of measurement provide standards for comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. A meter stick is an example of a standard. When something is measured with a meterstick, we compare their similar property with the meterstick. For example, if we measure a height of a pillar with a meterstick and found that height to be 6 meter then 6 is a number of times meterstick used in the measurement and meter is a unit (or length) of meterstick. This makes measurement easier and uniform.  There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether known as the base quantities. Their units are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. The diverse human history and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and CGS (centimeter gram second). The FPS system of units is also called British system and MKS system is also called a metric system. The metric system is a decimalized system of measurement developed in France in late century. Since the metric system is almost universally used, it is often referred to as the International System of Units and abbreviated SI. Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in table 1.1.   The Systems of Units    Base Quantity  SI Units  Symbol    Mass  Kilogram  kg    Length  Meter  m    Time  Second  s    Amount of Substance  Mole  mol    Electric Current  Ampere  A    Temperature  Kelvin  K    Luminous Intensity  Candela  cd       Derived Units  Derived quantities are defined in terms of mathematical relation between the base quantities.    .
