<div class="para">The phases of the moon [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-moonphase.html" title="Figure 12.2.1.(b)">Figure 12.2.1.(b)</a>] refer to the appearance of the illuminated portion of the moon as seen from Earth as it orbits around our planet. The moon goes through a cycle of eight distinct phases:</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">New Moon:</dfn> The moon is not visible from Earth because it is positioned between the sun and Earth.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Waxing Crescent:</dfn> A small crescent of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion increasing each night.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">First Quarter:</dfn> Half of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion continuing to increase.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Waxing Gibbous:</dfn> More than half, but not yet fully, of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion still increasing.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Full Moon:</dfn> The entire illuminated portion of the moon is visible from Earth.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Waning Gibbous:</dfn> More than half, but not yet fully, of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion decreasing each night.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Third Quarter:</dfn> Half of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion continuing to decrease.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Waning Crescent:</dfn>  A small crescent of the moon is visible, with the illuminated portion decreasing each night until the cycle begins again with the new moon.</div></li>

<div class="para">Moon spins on its axis in about 27.3 Earth’s days. This time is known as sidereal month. A <dfn class="terminology">sidereal month</dfn> is the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth as measured relative to the fixed distant stars. This is slightly shorter than the time (29.53 days) it takes for the Moon to return to the same phase (such as full moon to full moon) as observed from Earth. This time is known as the <dfn class="terminology">synodic month</dfn> or Lunar month. This is the same amount of time that the Moon takes to orbit around the Earth as seen from the moon. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, a phenomenon known as <em class="emphasis">tidal locking.</em> While the moon orbits a complete circle around the earth, the earth itself rotates around the sun. The difference between these two periods is due to the fact that the Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, so the Moon has to travel slightly farther to complete a full cycle of phases as seen from Earth.</div>
