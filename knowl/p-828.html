<div class="para">The Moon does not have a significant <dfn class="terminology">atmosphere</dfn> like Earth's, but it does have a very thin and tenuous exosphere. The exosphere is a layer of gas that is so sparse that its particles rarely collide with each other. It is made up mostly of particles that have been ejected from the Moon's surface by impacts from solar wind and micrometeoroids. The exosphere is composed mainly of helium-4, neon, and argon, which are the lightest and most volatile elements found in the solar system. There are also trace amounts of other gases, such as hydrogen, helium-3, and methane. The total mass of the exosphere is only about 10 metric tons, which is less than a billionth of the mass of Earth's atmosphere. The lack of a significant atmosphere on the Moon means that there is no weather, no wind, and no erosion by air or water. However, the exosphere does have some important effects on the Moon's surface, such as influencing the behavior of charged particles from the solar wind and affecting the distribution of dust and other materials on the surface. The exosphere also presents some challenges for future human exploration and settlement of the Moon, as it can be difficult to manage and may pose health risks to astronauts.</div>
