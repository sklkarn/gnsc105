<div class="para">The Andromeda Galaxy [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-andromeda.html" title="Figure 14.1.1.(c)">FigureÂ 14.1.1.(c)</a>], also known as Messier 31 or M31, is a spiral galaxy located about 2.5 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy is about 220,000 light-years in diameter, making it almost twice as large as the Milky Way. It contains about a trillion stars, which is more than three times the number of stars in the Milky Way. Like the Milky Way, it has a central bulge and spiral arms that wrap around it.</div>
