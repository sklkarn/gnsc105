<dfn class="terminology">Cyclones and Anticyclones</dfn> Cyclones and anticyclones are weather systems that are characterized by areas of low and high pressure, respectively. <dfn class="terminology">Cyclones</dfn>  are powerful rotating storms that can form over warm ocean waters. Cyclones are characterized by their low pressure center, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Cyclones form when warm, moist air over the ocean rises and cools, causing water vapor to condense and form clouds. As the air continues to rise, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface, which draws in more warm, moist air. This cycle of rising warm air and low pressure continues, causing the storm to intensify. In the Northern Hemisphere, cyclones rotate counterclockwise and move in a west to east direction, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate clockwise and move in an east to west direction. Cyclones are commonly referred to as hurricanes, typhoons, or tropical storms when they occur over warm ocean waters. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cycantcyc.html" title="Figure 10.2.3">FigureÂ 10.2.3</a>.</div>
