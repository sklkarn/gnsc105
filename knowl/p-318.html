<div class="para">It is a process of the transfer of heat  from one location to another due to temperature difference. Heat can only flow from high temperature to low temperature. There are three processes involved in heat transfer. They are conduction, convection, and radiation. <dfn class="terminology">Conduction:</dfn>  In this process heat is transferred through a body by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated, these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating at even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so, they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying particles do not physically move from their place rather they transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time one particle knocks onto another it passes some of its energy to the next one then returns to its original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collision and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.</div>
