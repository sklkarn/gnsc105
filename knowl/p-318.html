<div class="para">When an object is placed in a fluid it experiences an upthrust force called a buoyant force. It is arising due to changes of pressure inside fluid. This phenomenon is known as Archimedes' principle . It states that when a body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced. That is, a buoyant force (<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>) = weight of displaced fluid (<span class="process-math">\(w_{df}\)</span>).</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
B= w_{df} = m_{df}\cdot g = V_{df}\cdot d\cdot g\tag{4.2.4}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">It is the buoyant force due to which your weight feels less in sweeming pool. Actually buoyant force is the <em class="emphasis">loss of weight</em> of object in a liquid or fluid. It can also be defined as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
B= w_{a} -w_{l} \tag{4.2.5}

<div class="para">Here, <span class="process-math">\(w_{a}\)</span> is a weight of an object in air and <span class="process-math">\(w_{l}\)</span> is a weight of an object in liquid. <dfn class="terminology">Archimedes' principle</dfn> tells whether the object floats or sinks in the fluid. If weight of the object is greater than the buoyany force, it sinks. If its weight is equal to the buoyant force, it submerges inside the fluid but does not sink. If its weight is less than the buoyant force then it floats on the surface of liquid.</div>
