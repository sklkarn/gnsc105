<div class="para">Binding energy is the amount of energy required to separate a nucleons into the protons and neutrons. In an atomic nucleus, the protons and neutrons are held together by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances. The binding energy of a nucleus can be calculated by subtracting the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons from the total mass of the nucleus itself. According to Einstein's famous equation,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-emc.html">
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2\text{,}\tag{7.2.3}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">the mass difference between the two states is equivalent to the binding energy. The binding energy of a nucleus has important implications for both the stability of the nucleus and for the energy released during nuclear reactions. Nuclei with higher binding energy are generally more stable and less likely to undergo spontaneous decay, while nuclei with lower binding energy are more likely to undergo radioactive decay. Additionally, the energy released during nuclear reactions is directly proportional to the binding energy of the nucleus. When a nucleus is formed, protons and neutrons come together and bind to form the nucleus. This process is driven by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances to hold the particles together. The formation of a nucleus also leads to the release of energy. This energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiation and called the binding energy. It is the same amount of energy required to separate the protons and neutrons in the nucleus when broken down to individual components. For example: The deuterium (<span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{2}H\)</span>) has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. So when they break apart we expect the mass of deuterium atom equals the mass of one proton (i.e. <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{1}H\)</span>) and the mass of one neutron. Mass of one <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{1}H = 1.0078 u \)</span> and mass of one neutron = 1.0087 u. Therefore the total mass of</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-emc.html">
\begin{equation*}
{}_{1}^{2}H = 1.0078 u+1.0087 u= 2.0165u\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The measured mass of <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{2}H\)</span> however, is only <span class="process-math">\(2.0141 u,\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(0.0024 u\)</span> less than the combined mass of proton and neutron. This loss of mass (also known as <em class="emphasis">mass defect</em>) appears in the form of binding energy of the deuterium atom. Similarly when one deuterium nucleus combines with one tritium nucleus to form helium nucleus tremendous amount of energy released which was a binding energy. For example:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-emc.html">
\begin{equation*}
{}_{1}^{2}H + {}_{1}^{3}H \longrightarrow {}_{2}^{4}He + {}_{0}^{1}n +\text{energy}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Hence, the mass defect in this case is given by: total mass of <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{2}H + {}_{1}^{3}H = 2.0141u+3.0161 u= 5.0302u\)</span> and total mass of <span class="process-math">\({}_{2}^{4}He + {}_{0}^{1}n = 4.0026u+1.0087 u= 5.0113u\text{.}\)</span> Hence the difference in these masses is a mass defect, <span class="process-math">\(m = 0.0189u\text{.}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">Note:</em> Here <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is the <em class="alert">atomic mass unit</em>. <span class="process-math">\(1 u = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} kg\text{.}\)</span> This is the approximate mass of the hydrogen atom. Atomic mass unit is also caled Dalton. we can also consider <span class="process-math">\(1 u \)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(1 gram/mole.\)</span> 1 mole of anything is equal to <span class="process-math">\(6.022\times 10^{23}.\)</span> Now,</div>
