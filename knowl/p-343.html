<div class="para">On the basis of requirements of medium to propagate energy there are two types of waves.</div>

<div class="para">Mechanical waves require material medium to propagate such as sound waves, water waves, string waves, seismic waves, etc. Electromagnetic waves on the other hand do not need any medium but can propagate both in vacuum and in a medium, such as light waves, heat waves, radio waves, etc. Electromagnetic (em) waves are transverse in nature where electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of energy propagatation. Longitudinal waves occur when a spring is fixed at one end and pulled back and forth by the other end as shown in figure below. Transverse waves occur when a spring or string is fixed at one end and wiggled up and down by the other end as shown in figure below. Both the waves can be easily described by a transverse nature as they are periodic in nature. The crest is the highest point on a wave. The trough is the valley between two waves, is the lowest point. The wavelength, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is the distance, either between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. It is the length of one complete wave. The amplitude, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is the peak value (either positive or negative) of a wave. The distance from the undisturbed level (equilibrium position) to the trough or crest. The compression is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are crowded together. The rarefaction is the part of the longitudinal wave where the particles are spread apart. The wavelength is the distance from compression to compression or rarefaction to rarefaction in a pressure (longitudinal) wave. The frequency, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a number of complete waves per second. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
