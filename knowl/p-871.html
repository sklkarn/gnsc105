<div class="para">A telescope is an instrument used in astronomy to observe and study celestial objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and nebulae. It works by collecting and focusing light, allowing astronomers to see objects that are too faint or distant to be seen with the naked eye. The basic design of a telescope involves two main components: a lens or a mirror to collect and focus light, and an eyepiece or a camera to view or record the image. The lens or mirror is the most important part of the telescope, and its size and quality determine how much light the telescope can gather and how clear the image will be. There are several types of telescopes used in astronomy, including <dfn class="terminology">refracting telescopes, reflecting telescopes</dfn>, [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-telscp.html" title="Figure 13.1.1.(a)">Figure 13.1.1.(a)</a>] and compound telescopes that combine both. Beside these there are also other kinds of telescope based on what type of light (electromagnetic wave) it can use to gather information that is coming from stars. Such as Radio telescopes: <dfn class="terminology">Radio telescopes</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-radiotelscp.html" title="Figure 13.1.1.(b)">Figure 13.1.1.(b)</a>] use radio waves to observe celestial objects. They have large dish-shaped antennas that collect radio waves and a receiver that converts the waves into electrical signals that can be analyzed. Radio telescopes are used to study radio emissions from galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and other objects. <dfn class="terminology">X-ray telescopes:</dfn> X-ray telescopes use mirrors or grazing incidence optics to focus and reflect X-rays to create an image. They are typically mounted on satellites or high-altitude balloons to avoid absorption by the Earth's atmosphere. X-ray telescopes are used to study X-ray emissions from hot gas in galaxy clusters, supernova remnants, and other objects. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the intended use and the preferences of the observer. Telescopes play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe. They have allowed astronomers to observe and study objects and phenomena that were previously unknown, and have provided important data for testing and refining theories about the nature and behavior of the cosmos. Today, telescopes continue to be a vital tool for astronomers, from ground-based observatories to space-based telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.</div>
