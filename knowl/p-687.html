<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">atmosphere</dfn> is the layer of gases that surrounds our planet and is held in place by the Earth's gravity. It is a complex system that plays a vital role in supporting life on Earth. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of four main layers, each with its own unique characteristics. The lowermost layer is the <em class="alert">troposphere</em>, which extends from the Earth's surface to an altitude of about 8-15 kilometers. This is where all weather (such as clouds, rain) occurs, and it contains most of the Earth's breathable air. Above the troposphere is the <em class="alert">stratosphere</em>, which extends from about 15-50 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This layer contains the ozone layer, which helps protect the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Long distance flights (airoplanes and jets) fly in the lower level of this layer. Beyond the stratosphere is the <em class="alert">mesosphere</em>, which extends from about 50-85 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This layer is where <em class="emphasis">meteors</em> burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere is the <em class="alert">thermosphere</em>, which extends from about 85 kilometers to the edge of space. This layer is characterized by very low air density but very high temperatures, and it is where the auroras occur and the space shuttle orbits. Overall, the Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature and protecting it from harmful radiation. It also supports the water cycle, which is essential for life on Earth. Thermosphere is also known as ionosphere as the solar radiation ionizes the upper atmosphere into ions and electrons. During sun storms, depletions and enhancements of ionization may occur which results the beutiful aurora borialis with the help of earth magnetic field. Ionosphere makes long distance radio communication possible.</div>
