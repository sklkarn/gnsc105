<div class="para">Newton observed that when an object falls it was accelerated toward the earth. Since the cause of such acceleration is an unbalanced force, there must be a force pulling that object toward the earth. On this basis, he came up with an idea called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It states that any two masses in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically,</div>
