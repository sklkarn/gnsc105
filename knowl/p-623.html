<dfn class="terminology">Freezing point elevation</dfn> is a colligative property of a solution that describes the increase in the freezing point of a solvent when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. This phenomenon occurs because the presence of the solute interferes with the formation of the crystal lattice of the solvent during freezing. The magnitude of the freezing point elevation is proportional to the concentration of the solute in the solution. <dfn class="terminology">Melting point depression</dfn> is a colligative property of a solution that describes the decrease in the melting point of a solvent when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. This phenomenon occurs because the presence of the solute disrupts the regular crystal structure of the solvent during melting, making it more difficult for the solvent molecules to organize themselves into a solid. The magnitude of the melting point depression is proportional to the concentration of the solute in the solution.</div>
