<div class="para">A neutron star  is a type of compact star that is incredibly dense, with a diameter of only about 10-20 kilometers and a mass of around 1.4 to 3 times that of the Sun. Neutron stars [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-neutronstar.html" title="Figure 13.2.2.(a)">Figure 13.2.2.(a)</a>] are formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion, and the core of the star collapses under its own gravity, becoming so dense that protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. The extreme density of a neutron star means that it has a gravitational field that is over a billion times stronger than Earth's, and it spins very rapidly, often several times per second. This rapid rotation can produce intense magnetic fields, making neutron stars some of the strongest magnets in the universe. The strong magnetic fields can also produce beams of radiation that are visible as pulsing signals, leading to the term <dfn class="terminology">pulsar</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-pulsars.html" title="Figure 13.2.2.(b)">Figure 13.2.2.(b)</a>] for a rotating neutron star that emits such signals. Neutron stars are incredibly hot, with surface temperatures estimated to be around 1 million degrees Celsius (1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit), and they emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to radio waves. They are also believed to be a source of heavy elements in the universe, as they are thought to be involved in the production of many of the elements beyond iron.</div>
