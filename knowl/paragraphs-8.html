<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Spectrum Analysis.</span></h4> <div class="para">Blackbody radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object that absorbs all radiation incident upon it, and then emits radiation in thermal equilibrium. The spectrum of blackbody radiation depends only on the temperature of the object, and not on its composition or other properties. The spectrum of blackbody radiation can be described by Planck's law, which relates the energy density of radiation at a given wavelength to the temperature of the emitting object. The resulting spectrum is a continuous distribution of radiation with a peak wavelength that depends on the temperature of the object. As the temperature increases, the peak wavelength of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the total amount of radiation emitted increases. Spectrum analysis is the process of breaking down the light emitted by an object into its constituent colors or wavelengths, using a spectrometer or other instrument. By analyzing the spectrum of an object, astronomers can determine its composition, temperature, and other physical properties. When a star emits light, it produces a continuous spectrum of blackbody radiation that is modified by absorption lines caused by the presence of specific chemical elements in the star's atmosphere. By analyzing the absorption lines in a star's spectrum, astronomers can determine the chemical composition and other properties of the star. Spectrum analysis is also used to study other celestial objects, such as galaxies, supernovae, and quasars. By analyzing the spectrum of these objects, astronomers can determine their composition, motion, and other physical properties, and gain insights into the nature and behavior of the universe.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_thirteenth-observ.html#paragraphs-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
