<div class="para">The Moon [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-moon.html" title="Figure 12.2.1.(a)">Figure 12.2.1.(a)</a>]  is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It is approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away from Earth and has a diameter of 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles). The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the solar system, when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth. The Moon’s surface is covered in craters, mountains, valleys, and vast plains called maria, which were formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere, and has no active geological processes. The temperature on the Moon can vary from 253 degrees Fahrenheit (123 degrees Celsius) in daytime to -387 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees Celsius) at nighttime.</div>
