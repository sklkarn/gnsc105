<div class="para">A movement of large sections of the Earthâ€™s lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth) relative to each other is known as tectonic movement. The lithosphere is broken up into a number of plates that move around on the underlying asthenosphere (the partially molten, ductile region of the mantle). Tectonic movement occurs primarily at plate boundaries, where plates interact with each other. Plate boundaries are <dfn class="terminology">Divergent:</dfn> (where plates <em class="emphasis">move away from each other</em>, creating a new crust. This occurs mainly at mid-ocean ridges), <dfn class="terminology">Convergent:</dfn> (where plates move towards each other and <em class="emphasis">one plate is usually subducted (forced beneath) under the other</em>. This can cause earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain-building), <dfn class="terminology">Transform:</dfn> (where plates slide past each other horizontally. This can also cause earthquakes). The movement of molten rock in the mantle can cause the tectonic movement.</div>
