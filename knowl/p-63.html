<div class="para">In vertical direction earth plays a vitol role in the acceleration of object motion. Earth pulls every thing downwards which causes acceleration due to gravity, <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> negative. Accleration due to gravity is the acceleration of the object caused by the earth gravitational field. The value of <span class="process-math">\(g =9.8 m/s^2\text{.}\)</span> In vertical motion, we consider height as positive if going up (y-axis) and height as negative if coming down. But here, we are taking <span class="process-math">\(g = -9.8 m/s^2.\)</span> if the object is going vertically up, and <span class="process-math">\(g =+9.8 m/s^2.\)</span> for the object falling down. Such conventions allow us to assume h as always positive.</div>
