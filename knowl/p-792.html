<div class="para">The formation of ozone <span class="process-math">\((O_3)\)</span> in the Earth’s atmosphere occurs through a complex reactions of oxygen molecules <span class="process-math">\((O_2)\)</span> and a variety of other compounds. One of the most important reactions involved in the formation of ozone is the photodissociation of oxygen molecules by ultraviolet (UV) radiation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
O_2 + UV radiation → 2O
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The resulting oxygen atoms (O) then react with other oxygen molecules <span class="process-math">\((O_2)\)</span> to form ozone:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
O + O_2 → O_3 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this reaction, some third molecule must collide with the oxygen atoms to stabilize the reaction. Nitrogen molecules <span class="process-math">\((N_2)\)</span> are the most common third molecule in the Earth’s atmosphere. The formation of ozone is a delicate balance between the production and destruction of ozone molecules. Ozone can also be destroyed through chemical reactions involving other compounds such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and chlorine compounds (Cl), which can be released from human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and the use of certain chemicals. This is why it is important to monitor and regulate the release of these substances to prevent the depletion of the ozone layer.</div>
