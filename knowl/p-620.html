<em class="alert">"Like dissolves like"</em> is a principle in chemistry that states that substances with similar polarities and intermolecular forces tend to dissolve in each other. In other words, a solvent will dissolve a solute if the intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute molecules are similar. Polar molecules have an uneven distribution of electrons and have a partial positive and partial negative charge. Nonpolar molecules have an even distribution of electrons and do not have a net electrical charge. When a polar solute is added to a polar solvent, the polar molecules of the solute interact with the polar molecules of the solvent through intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions. This makes it easier for the solute to dissolve in the solvent. Similarly, when a nonpolar solute is added to a nonpolar solvent, the nonpolar molecules of the solute interact with the nonpolar molecules of the solvent through van der Waals forces, making it easier for the solute to dissolve in the solvent. On the other hand, if a polar solute is added to a nonpolar solvent, or vice versa, the polar and nonpolar molecules do not interact as easily, and the solute may not dissolve in the solvent. <em class="emphasis">For example:</em> sugar (a polar solute) does not dissolve well in oil (a nonpolar solvent) because their polarities do not match. Oil (a nonpolar solute) does not dissolve well in water (a polar solvent) because their polarities do not match. Water can be an effective cleaning agent for removing certain types of dirt, such as dust or mud, from surfaces like floors, walls, or furniture. However, if the dirt is greasy or oily, water alone may not be enough to remove it, and additional cleaning agents or solvents (such as soap) may be needed.</div>
