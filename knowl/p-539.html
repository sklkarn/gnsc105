<div class="para"> In the successive evolution of atomic model, we needed to understant light very well. From the late 19th century, scientists realized that visible light of all frequencies was emitted by the atoms of glowing hot solid, such as the filament of light bulb. The study of blackbody radiation helps understand the nature of heat and light. Blackbody radiation is a cornerstone in the study of quantum mechanics.This experiment led to the discovery of Quantum mechanics which gives a complete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at the sub-atomic level. <dfn class="terminology">Blackbody radiation</dfn> is the theoretical description of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect blackbody, which is an object that absorbs all radiation falling on it and reflects none. In 1900, Max Planck proposed a theoretical model to explain the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation, which was in agreement with experimental observations. Planck’s model proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets, called quanta, rather than continuously. This was a major departure from classical physics and marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. Planck’s work laid the foundation for the understanding of the nature of light and electromagnetic radiation and has had a profound impact on modern physics. The study of blackbody radiation continues to be an important area of research in physics.</div>
