<div class="para"> A blackbody in physics describes an ideal object which can absorb all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it, at any wavelengths. Because it absorbs all frequencies of light, a perfect blackbody would appear completely black to the human eye. While perfect blackbodies donâ€™t exist in nature, the concept is very useful in understanding how real objects emit and absorb radiation. It is our experience that when a metal rod is heated, it turns red at low temperature, then as the temperature increases its color changed into orange, yellow, white, and blue. Stars are often approximated as blackbodies, which helps us understand how they radiate light at different temperatures.</div>
