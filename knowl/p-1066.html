<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">brown dwarf</dfn> is a type of substellar object that is too massive to be classified as a planet but not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion in its core, which is the process that powers stars. Brown dwarfs have a mass between that of the heaviest gas giant planets and the lightest stars, typically ranging from about 13 to 80 times the mass of Jupiter. It can be called as a prenatal defects star. Because brown dwarfs cannot sustain nuclear fusion, they gradually cool and dim over time, eventually becoming cold and dark objects similar in temperature and appearance to planets. However, unlike planets, brown dwarfs form in the same way as stars, from the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. Brown dwarfs are difficult to observe directly because they are relatively dim and emit most of their radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum. However, they can be detected using a variety of methods, including their gravitational influence on nearby objects and the heat they emit as they cool. Brown dwarfs are important objects for astronomers to study because they provide a link between planets and stars and can help us understand the formation and evolution of these objects.</div>
