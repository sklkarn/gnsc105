<em class="alert">Newtonâ€™s third law</em> is the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Force always comes in pair. If an object A applies the action force on the object B then object B also applies the same amount of reaction force on the object A. These forces pair always act on two different objects. If one object exerts a force on a second object, then the second object exerts an equal but oppositely directed force on the first object. Mathematically,</div>

<em class="emphasis">Some examples:</em> 1. Earth exerts force on you because you exert an equal and opposite force on earth. Here your force is your body weight and earth reaction force is a normal force. 2. When the rifle is fired it exerts a force on the bullet and the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the rifle. 3. You are able to sweem in water because you pushes water backwardly so apply the force on water and in reaction water also applies the same force on you just in opposite direction so you can sweem nicely.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_second-force.html#li-145" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
