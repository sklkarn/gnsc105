<dfn class="terminology">Normal:</dfn> This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. <dfn class="terminology">Tension:</dfn> is a pulling force. It is a force acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string and acting along the directions to taut string at the point of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. <dfn class="terminology">Spring force:</dfn> A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. The elastic property in a material has the ability to restore its shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From <dfn class="terminology">Hook's law</dfn> a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, spring force,</div>
