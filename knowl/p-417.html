<dfn class="terminology">Rutherford's atomic model</dfn>, also known as the "planetary" model, was proposed in 1911 based on his gold foil experiment. The experiment involved firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observing their deflection patterns using a screen. The results showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, but a small percentage were deflected at large angles, suggesting the presence of a heavy and dense nucleus at the center of the atom. Rutherford's atomic model proposed that an atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its center surrounded by electrons in orbits around the nucleus. The electrons were held in their orbits by the attractive force between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons. This model explained why most alpha particles passed straight through the foil and why a small percentage were deflected at large angles. It also helped to establish the concept of the atomic nucleus and the basic structure of the atom. <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHaR2rsFNhg" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Gold's Foil Experiment</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
