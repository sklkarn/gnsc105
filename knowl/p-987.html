<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Oort Cloud</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-oortcloud.html" title="Figure 12.0.1.(b)">FigureÂ 12.0.1.(b)</a>] is a theoretical region of the outer solar system that is thought to be the source of most long-period comets. It is believed to extend from about 2,000 to 100,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which is well beyond the Kuiper Belt. The Oort Cloud is composed of icy objects, including comets, that are thought to have formed in the early solar system and were gravitationally scattered to the outer reaches of the solar system by the gas giants. The comets in the Oort Cloud can be perturbed by passing stars, which can send them on trajectories that bring them into the inner solar system, where they become visible as long-period comets. The Oort Cloud is named after Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence in 1950 based on observations of comets.</div>
