<dfn class="terminology">Normal:</dfn> This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. <dfn class="terminology">Tension:</dfn> This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the point of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. <dfn class="terminology">Spring force:</dfn> A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. Any material has elastic property which helps it to restore its shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, spring force, <span class="process-math">\(F=-kx\)</span> where k is a spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is stretch made on spring.</div>
