<div class="para">Solar energy refers to the energy that is generated from the sun's radiation. Stars produce energy through a process known as nuclear fusion [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nucfusionrxt.html" title="Figure 13.1.2.(b)">Figure 13.1.2.(b)</a>], which occurs in their cores. The high temperature and pressure in the core of a star cause the atomic nuclei to collide and merge, creating a heavier nucleus and releasing energy in the process. The most common fusion reaction in stars involves the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. This process requires a high temperature and pressure to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged atomic nuclei. Once the fusion reaction begins, it releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. The energy produced by the fusion reactions [<a href="sec_seventh-nucleus.html#subsec_7be-subsection" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.2.4: Binding Energy">Subsection 7.2.4</a>] <a class="external" href="https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/sunsolarenergy/fusion01.html" target="_blank">The Nuclear Fusion Reaction</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-82-hidden.html" title="Footnote 13.1.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> in a star is carried by radiation in the form of photons, which slowly make their way outwards from the core of the star. This energy is what powers the star and allows it to shine brightly in the sky. As a star ages and begins to run out of hydrogen fuel in its core, it may begin to undergo other fusion reactions that involve heavier elements. These reactions can produce even more energy, but eventually the star will exhaust all of its nuclear fuel and will either become a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole, depending on its mass.</div>
