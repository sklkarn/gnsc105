<div class="para">When a nucleus is formed, protons and neutrons come together and bind to form the nucleus. This process is driven by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances to hold the particles together. The formation of a nucleus also leads to the release of energy. This energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiation and called the binding energy. It is the same amount of energy required to separate the protons and neutrons in the nucleus when broken down to individual components. For example: The deuterium (<span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{2}H\)</span>) has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. So when they break apart we expect the mass of deuterium atom equals the mass of one proton (i.e. <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{1}H\)</span>) and the mass of one neutron. Mass of one <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{1}H = 1.0078 u \)</span> and mass of one neutron = 1.0087 u. Therefore the total mass of</div>

<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-34-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> However, the measured mass of <span class="process-math">\({}_{1}^{2}H\)</span> is only 2.0141 u, which is 0.0024 u less than the combined mass of proton and neutron. This loss of mass (also known as <em class="emphasis">mass defect</em>) appears in the form of binding energy of the deuterium atom. Similarly when one deuterium nucleus combines with one tritium nucleus to form helium nucleus tremendous amount of energy released which was a binding energy. For example:</div>
