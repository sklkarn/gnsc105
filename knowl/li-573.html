</h3>Group 16 (Chalcogens): This group includes the non-metals oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), polonium (Po), and livermorium (Lv). The chalcogens are known for their ability to form compounds with a wide range of other elements, and they are involved in many important biological and industrial processes. For example, oxygen is essential for respiration and combustion, while sulfur is used in the production of fertilizers and other chemicals. Selenium and tellurium are used in the manufacture of semiconductors, while polonium has important nuclear applications. They are non-metals, and they have relatively high electronegativities and melting points. They also tend to form compounds with other elements that are covalent or ionic in nature.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eighth-ptable.html#li-573" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
