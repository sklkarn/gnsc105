<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Kuiper Belt</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-solarsys3.html" title="Figure 12.0.1.(a)">FigureÂ 12.0.1.(a)</a>] is a region of the solar system located beyond the orbit of Neptune, extending from about 30 to 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. It is a vast region of space containing many small icy objects, including <dfn class="terminology">dwarf planets</dfn> such as <dfn class="terminology">Pluto,</dfn> Haumea, Makemake, and Eris, as well as numerous smaller bodies known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). The Kuiper Belt is thought to be the source of many short-period comets, which are believed to be icy bodies that originate from this region and are gravitationally perturbed by the gas giants, particularly Jupiter.</div>
