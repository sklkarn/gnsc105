<div class="para"> It is a phenomenon of redirected light in different directions when it interacts with small particles or irregular surfaces. This can cause the light to appear hazy or dispersed. Due to scattering sky looks bluish as blue colors scattered more in sky than any other colors from the visible spectrum of light. In fact, violet light scattered more than blue but our eyes are more sensitive o blue color than violet light hence blue colors are much more prevailed than others in sky. At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel longer distance in the atmosphere which causes most of the blue and other shorter wavelengths to scatter in the sky and only red color can reach to our eyes hence the sun appears reddish in color.</div>
