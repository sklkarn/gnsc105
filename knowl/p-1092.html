<div class="para">Galaxies are typically found in groups or clusters, which are collections of galaxies that are held together by gravity. There are several types of groups of galaxies, including:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Galaxy Groups: These are the smallest groupings of galaxies, consisting of a few (typically 2 to 50) galaxies that are gravitationally bound to one another. These groups often contain a central dominant galaxy, which is surrounded by smaller satellite galaxies.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Galaxy Clusters: These are larger groupings of galaxies, consisting of dozens to hundreds of galaxies that are gravitationally bound to one another. Galaxy clusters are often dominated by a few large galaxies at their centers and are surrounded by smaller satellite galaxies.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Superclusters: These are even larger groupings of galaxy clusters, consisting of dozens to hundreds of galaxy clusters that are gravitationally bound to one another. Superclusters are some of the largest known structures in the universe, with sizes of up to hundreds of millions of light-years.</div></li>
