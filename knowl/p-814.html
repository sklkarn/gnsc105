<div class="para">Erosion refers to the process by which soil, rock, and other geological materials are moved from one place to another by natural agents such as wind, water, ice, and gravity. Water erosion is one of the most common types of erosion, occurring when rainwater or runoff moves soil particles downhill and into streams or rivers. This can lead to the formation of gullies, stream channels, and river deltas. Wind erosion occurs when wind picks up and carries soil particles, causing them to be deposited in other areas and potentially causing soil degradation and loss of vegetation. Glacial erosion occurs when glaciers move over the land, scraping and eroding the surface and transporting rocks and other materials to other locations. Human activities such as deforestation, agriculture, and construction can also contribute to erosion by removing vegetation and disturbing the soil, leading to increased susceptibility to erosion by natural agents. Erosion can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. It can create new landforms and shape landscapes. It can also lead to soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and the accumulation of sediment in water bodies, which can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems.</div>
