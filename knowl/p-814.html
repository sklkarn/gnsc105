<div class="para">Weathering refers to the process by which rocks and other materials are broken down and degraded over time by exposure to the elements. This can happen through physical, chemical, or biological means, and can be caused by a variety of factors such as temperature changes, wind, water, and living organisms. Physical weathering involves the mechanical breakdown of rocks and other materials due to factors such as freeze-thaw cycles, abrasion, and the expansion and contraction of materials due to temperature changes. Chemical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks and other materials through chemical reactions such as oxidation, dissolution, and hydrolysis. Biological weathering involves the breakdown of materials due to the activities of living organisms such as plants, animals, and bacteria. Weathering plays a key role in the formation of soils, the erosion of mountains, and the creation of landscapes such as canyons and valleys.</div>
