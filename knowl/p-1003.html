<div class="para">Jupiter has a system of rings, but they are not as prominent or well-known as the rings of Saturn. Jupiterâ€™s rings are composed of small particles of rock and dust, and there are four main ring groups: the halo ring, the main ring, the Amalthea gossamer ring, and the Thebe gossamer ring. These rings are thought to be formed by dust kicked up from impacts on nearby moons, and they are constantly being replenished by new dust from these sources. The rings of Jupiter are much fainter and harder to see than the rings of Saturn, and were discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft.</div>
