<div class="para">Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).</div></li>
