<div class="para">Heat  is a transfer of energy because of temperature difference. When an object gains or loses heat it either changes its temperature or its phase (state). A change in temperature is associated with changes in the average kinetic energy of the particles and a change in phase is associated with changes in the internal potential energy possessed by the object. In this section we will learn how to measure the quantity of heat gained or released by an object.</div>
