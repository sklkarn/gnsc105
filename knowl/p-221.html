<div class="para">Momentum conservation is very useful in collision  problems because the collision force is internal and hence does not change the total momentum. The impulse of a collision is the total momentum transferred during the collision, where a <dfn class="terminology">collision</dfn> is an event where a very large force is exerted over a body for a very short interval of time, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span> During that interval magnitude of force is continuously changing. Therefore, the impulse of a force is the product of the average force and the time interval during the contact.</div>
