<div class="para">The Milky Way is a relatively large galaxy, with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and a mass of approximately 1 trillion times that of our sun. The galaxy's spiral arms are thought to be caused by density waves, which compress the interstellar gas and dust, triggering the formation of new stars. The Milky Way is home to many interesting and important celestial objects, including the galactic center, which is a region of intense radiation and contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 4 million times that of our sun. The Milky Way's disk is also surrounded by a halo of dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter <em class="emphasis">(Dark Matter)</em> that can only be detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter. The Milky Way is part of a larger group of galaxies known as the <dfn class="terminology">Local Group</dfn>, which also includes the <dfn class="terminology">Andromeda galaxy</dfn> and several other smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is also home to numerous <dfn class="terminology">open and globular clusters</dfn>, which are groups of stars that are held together by their mutual gravitational attraction.</div>
