<div class="para">There are a few general rules for naming molecules in chemistry, which vary slightly depending on the type of molecule being named. Here are some basic guidelines:</div>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Naming simple covalent compounds:</em> The first element in the formula is named first and the full element name is used. For example: in NaCl, the first name is <span class="process-math">\(sodium.\)</span> The second element is named as though it were an anion (negative ion), with the suffix <span class="process-math">\(ide\)</span> added to the root of the element name. For example: in NaCl, the second name is <span class="process-math">\(chloride\text{,}\)</span> in CaO: calcium oxide. Prefixes are used to indicate the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule. The prefix <span class="process-math">\(mono-\)</span> is usually omitted for the first element in the formula. For example: the name of <span class="process-math">\(CO_2\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">Carbon dioxide</em>, and the CO is <em class="emphasis">carbon monoxide</em>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Naming ionic compounds:</em> The cation (positive ion) is named first, followed by the anion (negative ion). The name of the cation is the same as the element name. The name of the anion is derived from the root of the element name, with the suffix <span class="process-math">\(ide\)</span> added. If the cation can have different charges, a Roman numeral is used to indicate the charge. For example: the name of iron (III) chloride is <em class="emphasis">FeCl_3</em>, and mercury (II) Oxide is <em class="emphasis">HgO</em>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Naming acids:</em> If the anion name ends in <span class="process-math">\(-ide\text{,}\)</span> the acid is named with the prefix <span class="process-math">\(hydro-\)</span> and the suffix <span class="process-math">\(-ic\text{,}\)</span> followed by the word "acid". If the anion name ends in <span class="process-math">\(-ate\text{,}\)</span> the acid is named with the suffix <span class="process-math">\(-ic\text{,}\)</span> followed by the word "acid". If the anion name ends in <span class="process-math">\(-ite\text{,}\)</span> the acid is named with the suffix <span class="process-math">\(-ous\text{,}\)</span> followed by the word "acid". For example: HCl - hydrochloric acid.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Naming organic compounds:</em> The root of the name comes from the number of carbon atoms in the molecule (meth-, eth-, prop-, but-, etc.). Functional groups (such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) are indicated by suffixes or prefixes. Numbering of the carbon atoms in the main chain starts at the end closest to a functional group, and the position of the functional group is indicated by a number. For example: <span class="process-math">\(CH_3CH_2OH\)</span> - ethanol.</div></li>
