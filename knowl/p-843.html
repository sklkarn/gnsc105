<dfn class="terminology">Mercury</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mercury.html" title="Figure 12.1.2">FigureÂ 12.1.2</a>] is the closest planet  to the sun in our solar system. It is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury, who was known for his speed. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and has a diameter of only 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles). Mercury's surface is heavily <em class="emphasis">cratered</em> and has a rocky, barren landscape. It has no atmosphere to speak of and experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between its day and night sides due to its proximity to the sun. During the day, temperatures can reach up to 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), while at night, they can drop to as low as -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). Mercury was visited by the <dfn class="terminology">Mariner 10</dfn> spacecraft in the 1970s, and more recently by the <dfn class="terminology">Messenger</dfn> spacecraft from 2011 to 2015.</div>
