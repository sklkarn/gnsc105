<dfn class="terminology">Igneous rocks</dfn> are formed from the solidification of magma or lava, and they make up a significant portion of the Earth’s crust. Common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian. Igneous rocks can form either on the Earth’s surface (extrusive) or beneath the surface (intrusive). Hence, it is of two types. <dfn class="terminology">Extrusive igneous rocks</dfn>, such as basalt and andesite, are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies quickly on the Earth’s surface. These rocks often have a fine-grained texture because the rapid cooling does not allow time for large crystals to form. <dfn class="terminology">Intrusive igneous rocks</dfn>, such as granite and gabbro, are formed when magma cools and solidifies slowly beneath the Earth’s surface. These rocks often have a coarse-grained texture because the slow cooling allows time for large crystals to form. Igneous rocks provide valuable information about the Earth’s history and geologic processes. For example, the composition of igneous rocks can give insight into the conditions and processes that led to their formation, such as volcanic activity or the melting and mixing of different rock types. Igneous rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals and metals, such as copper, gold, and silver.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-976" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
