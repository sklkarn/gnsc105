<div class="para">Wave  is a base to understand porperty, propagation, and nature of sound, light, heat, etc. in physics. A wave is a disturbance in space that carries energy from one location to another. <a class="external" href="https://javalab.org/en/water_waves_en/" target="_blank">Water wave</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-19-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> Sound waves, ocean waves, light waves, radio waves, etc. are some exaples of waves. Wave has properties like wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. It can reflect, refract, and interfere. Waves can be classified as transverse waves, longitudinal waves, mechanical waves, and electromagnetic waves. Waves can also be described as periodic (a regular pattern of oscillation) or aperiodic (or irregular pattern of oscillation). Sine wave and cosine waves are periodic waves as they repeat themselves at regular intervals, noise are aperiodic wave as they do not have a regular pattern of oscillation. Waves can be further classified as progressive or standing waves. Progressive waves move in forward direction, e.g. a wave moving in a rope or string. Standing waves do not move forward but seem stand still. Standing waves are formed when two or more waves of the same frequency moving in opposite directions get superimposed on one another. Here is the visulization of propressive and standing wave in the following link. <a class="external" href="https://www.walter-fendt.de/html5/phen/standingwavereflection_en.htm" target="_blank">propagating and standing wave</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-20-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
