<div class="para">Ocean basins are large depressions on the surface of the Earth that are filled with water. The ocean basins cover approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface and are divided into several major basins, including the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern Ocean basins. The ocean basins are formed by the process of plate tectonics, where the Earth’s crust is broken up into several large plates that move around on the Earth’s surface. As these plates move apart, new oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-trenchridge.html" title="Figure 11.4.4">Figure 11.4.4</a>], and the ocean basins are gradually widened. The ocean basins are also home to a wide variety of marine life, including fish, whales, dolphins, sharks, and many other types of sea creatures. <div class="para">Ocean basins are bounded by continental landmasses. Ocean bottom generally slopes downward from the <dfn class="terminology">continental shelves</dfn> to the deeper ocean basins. This slope is known as the <dfn class="terminology">continental slope</dfn> and is usually steeper than the continental shelf. The slope continues down to the deep-sea floor, which is generally characterized by a flat plain known as the <dfn class="terminology">abyssal plain</dfn>. <dfn class="terminology">Continental shelves</dfn> are areas of the ocean floor that extend from the continents and are covered by shallow water <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-basin.html" title="Figure 10.3.1">Figure 10.3.1</a>. They are part of the continental crust that is submerged below sea level, and they slope gradually downward from the shorelines to the deeper ocean basins. The <dfn class="terminology">ocean floor</dfn> is the bottom of the ocean which characterizes mountains, trenches, ridges, and plains.</div>
