<div class="para">Ocean basins are large depressions on the surface of the Earth that are filled with water. The ocean basins cover approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface and are divided into several major basins, including the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern Ocean basins. The ocean basins are formed by the process of plate tectonics, where the Earth’s crust is broken up into several large plates that move around on the Earth’s surface. As these plates move apart, new oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-trenchridge.html" title="Figure 11.4.4">Figure 11.4.4</a>], and the ocean basins are gradually widened. The ocean basins are also home to a wide variety of marine life, including fish, whales, dolphins, sharks, and many other types of sea creatures.</div>
