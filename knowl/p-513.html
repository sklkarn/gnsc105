<div class="para">Matter can undergo basically two types of changes. They are:</div>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Physical change:</dfn>  It is such a change in matter that do not alter its chemical composition. For examples:melting, freezing, boiling, condensation, and evaporation. Physical changes are kind of two-way trafic. The material transform its shape and state multiple times. For example, making jewelry from gold bar and molding them back into gold bar again, making sword from iron bar and converting sword in an iron bar again.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Chemical change:</dfn>  It is such a change in matter that alter its chemical composition. Fpr examples: burning, rusting, and the formation of a chemical compound. It is a one-way trafic where material transform its physical properties but never regains the original properties by the physical process. For example, Baking a cake, making yogurt from milk. The physical properties of the milk, such as its texture and flavor, are also altered in the process. Formation of a new chemical compound such as water from hydrogen and oxygen is also a chemical change.</div></li>
