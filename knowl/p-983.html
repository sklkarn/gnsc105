<div class="para">Saturn [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-saturn.html" title="Figure 12.1.7">FigureÂ 12.1.7</a>] is the sixth planet from the Sun and is known for its iconic rings, which are composed of countless icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to enormous boulders. It is a gas giant planet, meaning it is predominantly made up of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core at its center. Saturn has the second-largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, after Jupiter, and is known for its numerous moons, with at least 82 moons known to orbit the planet. The largest moon of Saturn is <dfn class="terminology">Titan</dfn>, which is the only known moon in the Solar System with a thick atmosphere and the potential to support life. Saturn is also known for its beautiful and dynamic weather patterns, including massive storms and hexagonal cloud formations at its north pole. The planet has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Voyager and Cassini missions, which have provided us with stunning images and valuable scientific data about this gas giant planet.</div>
