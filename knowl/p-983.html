<div class="para">Mars has two small moons, named <dfn class="terminology">Phobos and Deimos</dfn>, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Phobos is the larger and closer of the two moons, and is heavily cratered with deep grooves and ridges on its surface. Its surface is thought to be composed of a mixture of rock and dust, and it orbits Mars at a distance of only 9,377 km (5,827 miles), which is closer than any other moon in the Solar System relative to its host planet. Deimos is smaller and more irregularly shaped than Phobos, and has a smoother surface with fewer craters. Its surface is also thought to be composed of a mixture of rock and dust, and it orbits Mars at a distance of about 23,460 km (14,577 miles). Both Phobos and Deimos are relatively small and irregularly shaped, and are thought to be composed of materials similar to those found in asteroids. They have been studied in detail by several spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has provided us with high-resolution images and valuable scientific data about these small moons of Mars.</div>
