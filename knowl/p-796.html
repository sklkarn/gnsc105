<div class="para">One cubic meter volume of air van hold a maximum of about 30 grams of water vapor at temperature <span class="process-math">\(80 ^oF \text{.}\)</span> Dry air has zero relative humidity but saturated air has 100% relative humidity. <dfn class="terminology">Humid (or saturated)</dfn> air is very uncomfortable, since the rate of evaporation is slowed by the high levels of water contents already in the air. At that time, human skin cannot sweat (perspirate) properly and we feel uncomfirtable. <dfn class="terminology">Dew point:</dfn>  is another way of expressing the saturation. The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with the available water vapor causing condensation to occur. At this point, the air cannot hold any more moisture, and the excess water vapor begins to condense into liquid droplets. The dew point is an important measurement in weather forecasting, as it helps determine the likelihood of <em class="emphasis">dew, fog, or frost</em> formation.</div>
