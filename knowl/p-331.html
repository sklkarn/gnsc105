<div class="para">Flow of charges in DC current is similar to flowing water, but in AC current, charges do not go any where rather they are oscillating about the mean position at their respective position. Check the simulation link to visualize DC and AC current. <a class="external" href="https://javalab.org/en/dc_and_ac_en/" target="_blank">DC &amp; AC</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-14-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> AC is more efficient to transmit over long distances than DC. This is the reason why AC is used in power transmission and distribution as well as in motors and other equipment. It is also used in many household appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. AC can also be easily transformed to different voltages using a transformer, while this is not easy to achieve with DC. DC voltage can be stored in a device called battery, while AC voltage can not be stored.</div>
