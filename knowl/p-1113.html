<div class="para">The Milky Way [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-milkyway.html" title="Figure 14.1.1.(b)">Figure 14.1.1.(b)</a>] is a barred <em class="emphasis">spiral galaxy</em>, which is a type of galaxy characterized by a central bar-shaped structure and spiral arms that wrap around it. It is estimated to be about 13.6 billion years old and is located about 25,000 light-years from the galactic center. The Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars, as well as numerous other celestial objects, such as <em class="emphasis">planets, nebulae, and black holes</em>. The Milky Way’s spiral arms are thought to be sites of ongoing star formation, and it is believed that many of the elements that make up our solar system and our bodies were created in these stars. The Milky Way also contains a supermassive <dfn class="terminology">black hole</dfn> at its center, which is surrounded by a region of intense radiation known as the galactic bulge. Our solar system is located in one of the Milky Way’s spiral arms, and as a result, our view of the galaxy is heavily obscured by dust and gas. Nevertheless, scientists have been able to map out the structure of the Milky Way using a variety of techniques, such as observations of star motions and radio emissions from gas clouds.</div>
