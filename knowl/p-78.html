<div class="para">In normal day life, we encounter many examples where object moves along both horizontal and verticle direction together. Such type of motion is called projectile motion and the object moving in projectile motion is called a projectile. Hence, projectile is an object which has both horizontal as well as vertical motion. The path taken by the projectile is parabolic in nature [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-fig2c.html" title="Figure 2.1.3">FigureÂ 2.1.3</a>]. We are not dealing with mathematical operation related to projectile motion here but we try to understand the projectile motion by the following figure. Since gravity only acts on the  verticle direction the horizontal velocity remains constant always in projectile motion.</div>
