<div class="para">Energy is that physical quantity which does things for us. All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. Energy is needed to move cars along the road and boats on the water. It bakes a cake in the oven and keeps ice frozen in the freezer. It helps our body to grow and minds to think. Energy is a changing, doing, moving, and working things. Energy is the ability to produce change or do work. Due to energy we have light, heat, sound, motion, and growth. Technologies, survival of life, and even existance of universe depend upon energy. To understand energy we need to understand the work first.</div>
