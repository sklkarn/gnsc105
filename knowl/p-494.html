<div class="para">The modern periodic table is divided into two main categories: the "A" groups, also known as the main group elements, and the "B" groups, also known as the transition metals. The A groups, or main group elements, are located in columns 1, 2, and 13 to 18 of the periodic table. These elements are also known as the representative elements, and they are characterized by having valence electrons in the s and p orbitals of their outermost energy level. The A groups are further divided into two subcategories: the alkali metals (Group 1) and the alkaline earth metals (Group 2), which are located on the far left side of the periodic table, and the post-transition metals (Groups 13-16), the halogens (Group 17), and the noble gases (Group 18), which are located on the right side of the table. The Group 16 elements are also known as chalcogenide group. The group includes the following six elements: oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), polonium (Po), and livermorium (Lv). The chalcogens are known for their ability to form compounds with a wide range of other elements, and they are involved in many important biological and industrial processes. For example, oxygen is essential for respiration and combustion, while sulfur is used in the production of fertilizers and other chemicals. Selenium and tellurium are used in the manufacture of semiconductors, while polonium has important nuclear applications. They are non-metals, and they have relatively high electronegativities and melting points. They also tend to form compounds with other elements that are covalent or ionic in nature.</div>
