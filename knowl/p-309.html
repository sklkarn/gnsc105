<div class="para">The most familiar magnet is a bar magnet. It is a piece of iron bar that has been magnetized. However, other shape of magnets are also available these days such as disk magnet, horseshoe magnet, ring magnet, etc. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/fig5f.png" class="contained"></div>

These stronger regions are called magnetic poles. One is designted as <em class="emphasis">north pole, N</em> and the other as <em class="emphasis">south pole, S</em>. This is because When a magnet is hanged by a thread and allowed to rotate freely, it will align itself in a north-south direction, due to the earth's magnetic field. The north end of the magnet will point towards the Earth's geographic north pole and the south end towards the Earth's geographic south pole. This is why north pole is also known as <em class="emphasis">north seeking pole</em> and the south pole as <em class="emphasis">south seeking pole</em>. The magnet also aligns at an angle itself with the earth's horizontal plane. This angle is known as the <em class="alert">angle of dip or inclination</em>, it varies depending on the location on the earth surface. The magnet also aligns itseld at an angle from the true north-south direction. This angle is known as <em class="alert">magnetic declinaiton</em>. The magnetic declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north direction. Magnetic north is the direction indicated by a compass, and true north is the direction of the Earth's geographic north pole. This angle can vary depending on location and time. <a class="external" href="https://simphy.com/weblets/earth-magnetic-field-simulation-3d/" target="_blank">earth as a magnet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
