<div class="para">Now we are slowly dawnning to fuzzy boundary between physics and chemistry. Chemistry has a long history that spans thousands of years. The earliest known efforts to understand matter and its transformations can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In the ancient world, alchemy was a precursor to modern chemistry that involved the study of turning base metals into gold, the preparation of elixirs and other substances, and the creation of potions and remedies. However, the practices of alchemy often lacked a systematic and scientific approach, and were more focused on superstition and magic. During the medieval period, alchemists made significant contributions to the development of chemistry by translating and preserving the works of ancient Greek philosophers. They also developed new theories and methods of their own, such as the concept of chemical elements and the use of laboratory equipment. The scientific revolution of the <span class="process-math">\(16^{th}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(17^{th}\)</span>  centuries marked a turning point in the history of chemistry. Scientists such as Robert Boyle and Antoine Lavoisier established the scientific method and introduced precise experimentation and quantification to the study of chemistry. Lavoisier’s law of conservation of mass and his systematic approach to chemical reactions helped to lay the foundation of modern chemistry. Throughout the <span class="process-math">\(19^{th}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(20^{th}\)</span> centuries, chemistry continued to develop and expand, with major contributions from scientists such as John Dalton, Jöns Jakob Berzelius, and Dmitri Mendeleev. The discovery of new elements, the development of the periodic table of elements, and the formulation of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics revolutionized our understanding of matter and its transformations. In recent years, the advances in technology and computing have enabled new areas of research and discovery in chemistry, such as green chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry. Today, chemistry plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, including medicine, energy, food, and materials, and continues to be an important and dynamic field of study.</div>
