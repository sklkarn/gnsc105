<dfn class="terminology">Ozone</dfn> is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms <span class="process-math">\((O_3)\)</span> and is an important component of the Earth's atmosphere. It is a highly reactive gas and is often referred to as a "reactive oxygen species". Ozone plays an essential role in absorbing and filtering harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which can damage living organisms and cause skin cancer and other health problems. The <dfn class="terminology">ozonosphere</dfn>, also known as the ozone layer, is a region of the Earth's stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone. It is located approximately 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface and is responsible for absorbing most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation before it reaches the Earth's surface. The depletion of the ozone layer, caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other pollutants into the atmosphere, is a significant environmental concern. The reduction of the ozone layer has been linked to an increase in skin cancer, cataracts, and other health problems, as well as changes in global weather patterns. Many countries have taken steps to reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances and to protect the ozone layer.</div>
