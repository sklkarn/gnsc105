<div class="para">Solstices and equinoxes are important astronomical events that mark the changing seasons on Earth. <dfn class="terminology">Solstices</dfn> occur twice a year, around June 20-22 and December 21-23, and mark the points in the Earth's orbit around the Sun when one of the Earth's poles is tilted most directly towards or away from the Sun. During the June solstice, which marks the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere. During the December solstice, which marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere, the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in the longest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere.</div>
