<div class="para">Observational astronomy is the branch of astronomy that deals with observing celestial objects and phenomena using telescopes and other instruments. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data obtained from observations of the sky. Observational astronomers study a wide range of objects and phenomena, including stars, galaxies, planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. They use various techniques to gather data, such as visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomers use telescopes, cameras, and other instruments to collect data, and then analyze that data to draw conclusions about the nature and behavior of celestial objects. They may also use computer simulations and models to better understand what they observe. Observational astronomy is a critical field of study in modern astrophysics, as it provides the data and insights necessary to test and refine theories about the nature of the universe. It also plays a key role in developing new technologies and techniques for studying the cosmos.</div>
