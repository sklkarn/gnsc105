</h2>The Cenozoic era is the most recent era of Earthâ€™s history, following the Mesozoic era and spanning from 66 million years ago to the present day. It is divided into three periods: the Paleogene, the Neogene, and the Quaternary. During the Cenozoic era, the Earth underwent significant changes, including the evolution of mammals and the emergence of modern humans. The Paleogene period saw the rise of mammals after the extinction of the dinosaurs, with many groups diversifying and evolving to occupy new ecological niches. The Neogene period saw the diversification of grasses and the evolution of many modern plant and animal groups. Finally, the Quaternary period saw the evolution of modern humans and the development of human societies.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-histgeol.html#li-1010" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
