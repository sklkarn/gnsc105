<div class="para">It is the amount of work required to move a unit positive charge from one point to another in an electric field. The unit of electric potential is the volt (V). A higher electric potential difference between two points indicates a greater amount of energy required to move a unit charge between those points. Voltage can be thought of as a "push" for a charge. The higher the voltage, the more "push" the charge experiences to flow through wires. Charge can only flow from high potential(voltage) to low potential (voltage). It's important to note that just like water can be dangerous if not handled properly, electricity can also be dangerous if not handled with care.</div>
