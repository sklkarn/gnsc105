<div class="para">The most important reaction that leads to the depletion of ozone is as follows:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
CFCl_3 + UV radiation → Cl· + CFCl_2 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The chlorine radical (Cl·) produced in the above reaction reacts with ozone <span class="process-math">\((O_3)\)</span> as follows:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Cl· + O_3 → ClO· + O_2  
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The ClO· radical then reacts with another oxygen molecule <span class="process-math">\((O_2)\)</span> to form more chlorine radicals:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ClO· + O → Cl· + O_2  
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The chlorine radical produced in the second reaction then repeats the cycle, reacting with more ozone molecules to produce more chlorine radicals. This cycle continues until a large amount of ozone has been depleted. Another reaction that can also lead to ozone depletion involves bromine compounds, such as halons and methyl bromide, which are also released into the atmosphere from human activities.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Br· + O_3 → BrO· + O_2   
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
BrO· + O → Br· + O_2  
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The bromine radical (Br·) produced in the first reaction then reacts with more ozone molecules, leading to further ozone depletion. These reactions are of particular concern because they can destroy large amounts of ozone in a short period of time.</div>
