<div class="para">Earth <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-globe.html" title="Figure 11.0.1.(a)">Figure 11.0.1.(a)</a>is the third planet from the sun and is the only known planet in the universe that supports life. It has a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and a mass of approximately <span class="process-math">\(5.97 \times 10^24 \)</span>kilograms. It has a unique atmosphere that is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is covered by approximately 71% water, which is contained in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the remaining 29% is composed of landmasses, such as continents and islands. The Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field, which protects it from harmful solar winds and radiation. The planet also has a natural satellite, the moon, which orbits around it. The Earth is a dynamic and constantly changing planet, with a complex system of tectonic plates that cause earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. It is also home to a diverse range of life forms, including humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms. <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ncfAsmiSg" target="_blank">Layers of Earth</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-56-hidden.html" title="Footnote 11.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
