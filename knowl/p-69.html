<li><div class="para">Gravitational force: The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Electromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force exists due to the charge in the object. It is also a long range force. It holds all the atoms and molecules together. We discuss this force later in another chapter.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Strong nucleur force: The strong nucleur force is a short range force and it exists only inside the nucleus. It binds all the nucleons together to have atomic existance. We may discuss this force little bit more in another chapter.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Weak nuclear force: The weak nucleur force is also short range force and only exists inside the nucleus. It is responsible for radioactivity of nucleous. The improper ratio of nucleons may cause the weak nuclear force to exist. We may discuss this force little bit more in another chapter.</div></li>
