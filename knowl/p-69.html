<div class="para">Force is a push or pull. Force is anything that produces a change in the state of motion of an object. Applcation of force on an object can change its direction of motion or change its velocity. There are four fundamental forces in nature. They are</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Gravitational force or <dfn class="terminology">Force of Gravity:</dfn> The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(F = w = mg \text{.}\)</span> Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Electromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force exists due to the charge in the object. It is also a long range force but stronger than the gravitational force. It holds all the atoms and molecules together. We discuss this force later in another chapter.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Strong nucleur force: The strong nucleur force is a short range force and it exists only inside the nucleus. It binds all the nucleons together to have atomic existance. It is the strongest force in nature.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Weak nuclear force: The weak nucleur force is also short range force and only exists inside the nucleus. It is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is responsible for radioactivity of nucleous. The improper ratio of nucleons may cause the weak nuclear force to exist.</div></li>
