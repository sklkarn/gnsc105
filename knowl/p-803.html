<div class="para">Temperature differences play a key role in creating these pressure systems and driving the movement of air. For example, the equator receives more direct sunlight and is therefore warmer than the poles, creating a temperature gradient that drives the movement of air from the equator towards the poles. This creates the global circulation patterns of the atmosphere, such as the trade winds and the westerlies. Local temperature differences can also create wind patterns, such as sea breezes and land breezes. During the day, land heats up more quickly than water, creating an area of low pressure over the land. The cooler, higher-pressure air over the ocean moves towards the land, creating a sea breeze. At night, the situation is reversed, with the land cooling down more quickly than the ocean and creating a high-pressure area. This causes the air to move from the land towards the ocean, creating a land breeze. Overall, temperature differences play a crucial role in creating the pressure systems that drive wind patterns and influence weather patterns across the Earthâ€™s surface.</div>
