<div class="para">Faults are crack in the earth's crust. Fults involve the movement of rock layers relative to each other. Here are some of the most common types of faults: <dfn class="terminology">Normal fault:</dfn> occurs when two blocks of rock are pulled apart, causing one block to drop down relative to the other. Normal faults are common in areas where the Earth's crust is being stretched, such as at divergent plate boundaries. <dfn class="terminology">Reverse fault:</dfn> occurs when two blocks of rock are pushed together, causing one block to be pushed up relative to the other. Reverse faults are common in areas where the Earth's crust is being compressed, such as at convergent plate boundaries. <dfn class="terminology">Strike-slip fault:</dfn> occurs when two blocks of rock slide past each other horizontally. Strike-slip faults are common in areas where the Earth's crust is being sheared, such as at transform plate boundaries. <dfn class="terminology">Thrust fault:</dfn> is a type of reverse fault in which the angle of the fault plane is shallow. Thrust faults are common in areas where the Earth's crust is being compressed, such as in mountain ranges.</div>
