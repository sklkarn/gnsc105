<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">polar</dfn>  molecule has none symmetrical distribution of electrons between its atoms resulting in a permanent dipole moment. This means that the molecule has a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other end. The polarity of a molecule is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the atoms that make up the molecule. If the electronegativity difference is large enough, the molecule will be polar. Examples of polar molecules include water <span class="process-math">\((H_2O)\text{,}\)</span> ammonia <span class="process-math">\((NH_3)\text{,}\)</span> and hydrogen chloride <span class="process-math">\((HCl)\text{.}\)</span> Polar molecules are important in many biological and chemical processes, including the formation of hydrogen bonds, the solubility of molecules in water, and the function of enzymes. Polar molecules attract each other due to the presence of partial positive and partial negative charges on opposite ends of the molecule. This attraction is known as a dipole-dipole interaction [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-polmol.html" title="Figure 9.1.2.(a)">FigureÂ 9.1.2.(a)</a>].</div>
