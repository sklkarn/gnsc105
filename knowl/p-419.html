<div class="para">It is a branch of physics which deals with the motion of charges in a conductor. When charge flows from one place to another, an electrical current is formed. An electric <dfn class="terminology">current</dfn>  is defined as the rate of flow of charge. If a net charge <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> passes through any conductor in time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then the electric current is given by</div>

<div class="para">Its unit is Ampere (A). One ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity and its conventional direction is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In conductor, current flows solely due to motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electrons flow. From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, the current is said to be direct current, or DC current. It is commonly used in electronic devices like cell phones and computers. If the direction of motion of charges reverses periodically, the current is known as an alternating current, or AC current. It is commonly used in the electrical power systems that supply to homes and commercial applications. AC current goes from positive to negative in a cycle, while DC current is always in the same direction. Current can only exist between two points of different potential (voltage) connected by a conductor and can only exist whenever a conductive path with no breaks is provided.</div>
