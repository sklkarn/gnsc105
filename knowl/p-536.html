<dfn class="terminology">Mole</dfn> is a unit used to measure the amount of a substance. One mole of a substance is defined as the amount of substance that contains the same number of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) as there are in 12 grams of carbon-12. This number is known as <dfn class="terminology">Avogadro's number, N_o</dfn> and is approximately <span class="process-math">\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \)</span> particles per mole. For example, one mole of water <span class="process-math">\((H_2O) \)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \)</span> water molecules, while one mole of sodium chloride <span class="process-math">\((NaCl)\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \)</span> sodium ions and <span class="process-math">\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \)</span> chloride ions. The mole is a convenient unit for chemists because it allows them to compare the amounts of different substances on the basis of the number of particles they contain, rather than their mass or volume. The number of atoms or molecules or anything in 1 mole of any substance is always the same as Avogadro's number.</div>
