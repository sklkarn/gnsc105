<em class="alert">Electrical Shock:</em> According to Ohm's law if resistance of the conductor is low then the higher current can flow through it. High current can be deadly. Actually, a “voltage” does not go “into” your body rather current can pass through it when charges flow toward a lower potential. In order to get electric shock atleast <span class="process-math">\(1mA\)</span> of current must pass through our body. In dry condition, human body has a resistance of about <span class="process-math">\(50000\Omega\text{,}\)</span> so to have <span class="process-math">\(1mA\)</span> current flowing through our body we need to touch the voltage source of about <span class="process-math">\(50 V\text{,}\)</span> as shown in the calculation below.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
V\amp =IR \\
or, \quad V \amp = 1\times 10^{-3}\times 50000\\
\therefore \quad V \amp =50
