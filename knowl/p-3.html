<div class="para">Physical science is an introductory book for non-scinece major students. It consists of introduction of physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in physical science courses. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some high school mathematical skills such as algebra and geometry.</div>
