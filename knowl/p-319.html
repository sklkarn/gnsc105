<div class="para">In this case, the volume of displaced liquid is equal to the volume of the submerged portion of the object. On this basis, we can tell that if the density of an object is greater than that of the fluid, it sinks. If object density is equal to the density of the fluid, then the object submerges. If an object's density is less than the density of the fluid, then the object floats. To make an iron ship not sink in water, it is made with wide surface area and its body is like a hollow shell, so that the density of the entire ship is less than the density of water.</div>
