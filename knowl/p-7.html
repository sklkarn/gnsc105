<div class="para">Scientific method is a series of logical steps followed by the investigators in conducting experimentation, making observation, and formulating hypothesis to solve or answer some specific questions about the natural world. The process is not linear but circular. Any question that cannot be proven or disproven through testing, cannot be included in scientific method. The steps of the scientific method are as follows:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Observation: we observe something that is interested to us to gather knowledge through our senses or collecting information using scientific instruments. For example, Follow the night sky throughout the year, where we can see some patterns of stars march in locked step accross the sky and some of the other bright objects are not.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Question: we formulate a question about what we have observed. For example, what are those bright objects in the sky that do not follow the locked step marching as other stars?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Hypothesis: we make a hypothesis. It is an idea that is suggested as an explanation for our observation to answer the question. It is important to note that a hypothesis must be testable. It means hypothesis must either be supported or falsified by your experiment. For example, we think that these are the wandering objects in the sky.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Experiment: we design and conduct an experiment that will test our hypothesis. Here we include and identify a controlled variable or dependent variable in our procedure that allow us to test a single variable in an experiment because they are unchanged. For example, look the relative motion between these objects and other stars in the sky. The stars positions are fixed and they do not have relative motion between them. However, the wandering objects move completely independtly in the sky.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Results: we report what happened in the experiment. For example, After careful experimentation and formulation we find that these wandering objects are not stars rather they are the same objects like our earth.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Conclusion: Here we conclude our results that has come from the data analysis. This section tells whether the experiment supported or rejected our hypothesis? If your hypothesis was supported, great. If not, repeat the experiment or think of ways to improve your procedure. For example, in our sky observation and experimentation we found that our hypothes was supported by the experiment and we gave the name of wandering objects as "Planets"</div></li>
