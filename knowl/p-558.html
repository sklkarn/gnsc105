<div class="para">The nucleus  contains protons and neutrons. The protons are positively charged particles and the neutrons have no charge. Nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons collectively known as known as <dfn class="terminology">nucleons</dfn>. The nucleons are held together by the strong nuclear force. Strong nuclear force is a very short-range attractive force that acts between nucleons and helps keep the nucleus from flying apart due to the repulsive force of the positively charged protons. The different number of neutrons in a nucleus of the same element forms the isotopes <em class="emphasis">isotopes</em> of the atom. <dfn class="terminology">Isotopes</dfn>  are atomic species of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. That is the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but a different atomic mass, hence isotopes can have different physical and chemical properties. Some isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, while others are radioactive and decay over time. Age of rocks, fossils, and evolution of the universe can be determined by using isotopes. Here is the isotopic natation of the nucleus.</div>
