<div class="para">There are several methods for measuring the distance to stars, some of the most common are: <dfn class="terminology">Parallax Method:</dfn> This is one of the most common methods used to determine the distance to nearby stars. It involves measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star when viewed from different positions in space. The distance to the star can be calculated using trigonometry with the angle between the two positions. <dfn class="terminology">Spectroscopic Method:</dfn> This method is used to measure the distance to stars by analyzing their spectra. The spectra of stars can be used to determine their temperature, luminosity, and composition, which can be used to estimate their distance. <dfn class="terminology">Main Sequence Fitting:</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hrdiagram.html" title="Figure 13.2.1.(a)">Figure 13.2.1.(a)</a>] This method involves comparing the brightness and temperature of a star with those of other stars whose distances have been accurately measured using other methods. By comparing the star’s characteristics to those of other stars with known distances, its distance can be estimated. <dfn class="terminology">Cepheid Variables:</dfn> Cepheid variables are pulsating stars with a well-defined relationship between their pulsation period and their luminosity. By measuring the period of Cepheid variable star, its luminosity can be estimated, and its distance calculated. <dfn class="terminology">Supernova Brightness:</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-supernova.html" title="Figure 13.2.1.(b)">Figure 13.2.1.(b)</a>] Type Ia supernovae are known to have a very consistent brightness, making them useful as standard candles for distance measurement. By comparing the observed brightness of a Type Ia supernova to its known intrinsic brightness, its distance can be calculated.</div>
