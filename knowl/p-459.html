<div class="para">Sound is a longitudinal wave that can be produced by vibration. The speed at which sound waves travel through a medium depends on the density and stiffness of the medium, whether condition, temperature, moisture, etc. It is a mechanical wave and creates pressure on a layer of medium when propagates, hence it is also called a pressure wave. Sound wave is longitudinal in nature. When such energy reaches to our eardrum it begins vibrating and we get sensation of hearing. The physical character of sound depends upon the listener's audible perception. The physical quantity that defines the loudness is amplitude (sound pressure) of the wave and the quantity that defines the timbre (or quality) of sound is a frequency <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> A sound of frequency <span class="process-math">\(20 Hz\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(20 kHz\)</span> is audible to healthy human ear. Loudness increases with the increase of pressure amplitude at a given frequency. Loudness (or Intensity level) is a sound energy received by a unit area of listener's eardrum (or detector) in unit time. Loudness is a listener's perception. Intensity is an energy carried by a wave per unit area per unit time. Intensity is a property of sound producing device. Loudness is an intensity received by a listener.</div>
