<dfn class="terminology">Radiation:</dfn>  It is the process in which heat transfers without the need of an intervening medium. Heat transfer occurs when electromagnetic waves are emitted or absorbed. The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer than those of the visible spectrum. In an atomic domain, the radiation is caused because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid that are accelerating electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with different efficiencies. A good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. A perfect absorber is called a black body (such perfection is not found in nature, but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. A black body absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit surface area of a perfect black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.</div>
