</h3>Continental-continental plate collision: When two continental plates collide, neither plate is subducted because both plates are too buoyant to sink. Instead, the collision can lead to the formation of massive mountain ranges and intense deformation of the continental crust. As the two continental plates collide, they crumple and fold, leading to the formation of complex mountain belts. The collision can also cause extensive faulting and fracturing of the crust, leading to the formation of deep basins and rift valleys. Over time, erosion can wear down the mountains, leading to the deposition of sedimentary rocks in the basins and valleys. One example of a continental-continental plate collision is the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which has led to the formation of the Himalayan mountain range, the tallest mountain range in the world. The collision between these two plates is ongoing, and the Himalayas continue to grow taller each year.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-platetect.html#li-1009" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
