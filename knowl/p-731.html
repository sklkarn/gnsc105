<div class="para">The point in the Earth's crust from where the energy is released is called the earthquake <dfn class="terminology">focus</dfn>. The <dfn class="terminology">epicenter</dfn> is the point on the Earth's surface directly above the focus. Focus is the place where crustal rocks moved and epicenter is the point on earth's surface directly over the focus as can be seen in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-focus.html" title="Figure 11.3.3.(b)">FigureÂ 11.3.3.(b)</a>. In seismology, <dfn class="terminology">shadow zones</dfn> refer to areas on the Earth's surface where seismic waves are not detected or are significantly weaker than in surrounding areas. The existence of these shadow zones was one of the key pieces of evidence used to support the theory of plate tectonics.</div>
