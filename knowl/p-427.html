<div class="para">The photoelectric effect was first observed by Hertz in the late 19th century and later explained by Einstein in 1905. The basic idea behind the photoelectric effect is that light is composed of individual particles, called photons, that carry a specific amount of energy. When these photons hit a metal surface, they transfer their energy to the electrons in the metal. If the energy of the photon is high enough, it can cause an electron to be ejected from the metal and become a free electron. This process only occurs with light of a certain frequency, known as the threshold frequency. If the frequency of the light is below this threshold, no electrons will be emitted, no matter how intense the light is. If the frequency is above the threshold, the number of electrons emitted will increase with the intensity of the light. The photoelectric effect challenged the classical understanding of light as a wave, and led to the development of quantum mechanics, which views light and matter as having both wave-like and particle-like properties. The photoelectric effect is widely used in modern technology, such as photodiodes, photovoltaics, and photoelectric sensors, etc. <a class="external" href="https://javalab.org/en/photoelectric_effect_2_en/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Photoelectric Effect Simulation.</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-32-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
