<div class="para">The pressure in the atmosphere varies with altitude, temperature, and weather conditions. At sea level, the average atmospheric pressure is about 1013 millibars (mb). This is commonly referred to as one atmosphere (1 atm) of pressure. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. This is because the weight of the air above decreases with increasing altitude. At an altitude of approximately 5.6 kilometers, the atmospheric pressure is about half of what it is at sea level. Temperature also affects atmospheric pressure. As temperature increases, the molecules in the air move faster and farther apart, which decreases the density of the air and, therefore, the atmospheric pressure. Similarly, as temperature decreases, the molecules in the air move slower and closer together, which increases the density of the air and, therefore, the atmospheric pressure. Weather conditions also affect atmospheric pressure. High-pressure systems are associated with clear, dry weather, while low-pressure systems are associated with cloudy, rainy weather. The movement and interaction of these high and low-pressure systems create weather patterns.</div>
