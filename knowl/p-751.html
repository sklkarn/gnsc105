<div class="para">Acids can be classified as either weak or strong, depending on their ability to dissociate in water. A <dfn class="terminology">strong acid</dfn> is an acid that completely dissociates in water, meaning that all of its molecules break apart into ions. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid <span class="process-math">\((HCl)\text{,}\)</span> sulfuric acid <span class="process-math">\((H_2SO_4)\text{,}\)</span> and nitric acid <span class="process-math">\((HNO_3)\text{.}\)</span> These acids have a very low pH and are highly reactive. A <dfn class="terminology">weak acid</dfn>, on the other hand, only partially dissociates in water, meaning that only a small fraction of its molecules break apart into ions. Examples of weak acids include acetic acid <span class="process-math">\((CH_3COOH)\text{,}\)</span> formic acid <span class="process-math">\((HCOOH)\text{,}\)</span> and citric acid <span class="process-math">\((C_6H_8O_7)\text{.}\)</span> These acids have a higher pH than strong acids and are less reactive. The strength of an acid is determined by its dissociation constant (Ka), which is a measure of how easily the acid donates a proton to water. A high Ka value indicates a strong acid, while a low Ka value indicates a weak acid. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
