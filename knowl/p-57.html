<div class="para">Vector quantity carries two pieces of information, i.e. magnitude and direction. Vector is often represented by an arrow. A straight line with an arrowhead where the length of the line yields information about MAGNITUDE and the arrow indicates the DIRECTION. Mathematical operation is different for vectors than in scalars. It is not just the addition or subtraction of the numbers. We are not going to perform many vector mathematical operations here rather we try to understand addition and subtraction with some simple examples. Addition or subtraction of scalar quantities are just like adding or subtracting the numbers. In vector addition,  the vectors are arranged in “HEAD TO TAIL” to find the sum of the vectors. In vector subtraction, the vector to be subtracted is flipped in direction and added to the other vector by arranging them in “HEAD TO TAIL” to find the sum of the vectors.</div>
