<div class="para">The Moon [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-moon.html" title="Figure 12.2.1.(a)">Figure 12.2.1.(a)</a>]  is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It is approximately 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth and has a diameter of 2,159 miles (3,474 kilometers). The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the solar system, when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth. The Moon’s surface is covered in craters, mountains, valleys, and vast plains called maria, which were formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere, and no active geological processes. The temperature on the Moon can vary greatly, with daytime temperatures reaching 253 degrees Fahrenheit (123 degrees Celsius) and nighttime temperatures dropping to -387 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees Celsius). The Moon has been the subject of scientific study for centuries and has been visited by astronauts from several countries. The first human landing on the Moon was accomplished by NASA’s Apollo 11 mission in 1969, and a total of twelve astronauts have walked on its surface between 1969 and 1972.</div>
