<div class="para">When an earthquake occurs, the energy released by the movement of the Earth's crust radiates outwards in the form of seismic waves. There are two main types of seismic waves: <dfn class="terminology">body waves and surface waves</dfn>. Body waves are the fastest seismic waves and travel through the interior of the Earth. There are two types of body waves: <dfn class="terminology">P waves (primary waves) and S waves (secondary waves)</dfn> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-pswave.html" title="Figure 11.3.1.(a)">Figure 11.3.1.(a)</a>. <em class="emphasis">P waves</em> are longitudinal waves that travel through the Earth's interior by causing the rock particles to move back and forth in the direction of wave propagation. <em class="emphasis">S waves</em> are transverse waves that travel by causing the rock particles to move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. S wave cannot pass through the liquid and hence it gets blocked by the core. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-waveprop.html" title="Figure 11.3.2">Figure 11.3.2</a> <em class="emphasis">Surface waves</em> are slower than the body waves and travel along the Earth's surface. There are two types of surface waves: <dfn class="terminology">Rayleigh waves and Love waves</dfn> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-surwave.html" title="Figure 11.3.1.(b)">Figure 11.3.1.(b)</a>. <em class="emphasis">Rayleigh waves</em> are similar to ocean waves and cause the ground to move in a rolling motion, while <em class="emphasis">Love waves</em> cause the ground to move in a side-to-side motion. Seismic waves can be transmitted through a variety of materials, including solid rock, sediment, and water. Seismic waves travel faster through dense, rigid materials such as solid rock, and slower through less dense, more fluid materials such as sediment. Seismic waves can also be reflected, refracted, and diffracted as they pass through different materials or encounter changes in the composition or structure of the Earth's crust. These interactions can cause seismic waves to change direction, speed up or slow down, and even amplify or dampen in intensity. By studying the behavior of seismic waves, scientists can gain insights into the internal structure and composition of the Earth's crust, as well as the properties of the materials through which the waves travel.</div>
