<div class="para">There are many types of thermometers in use, but we concentrate our study on three basic types. They are the Fahrenheit thermometer, the Celsius (or Centigrade) thermometer, and the Kelvin scale. Thermometers need calibration once they are made to provide correct temperature readings. To calibrate the thermometer the choice of unit and two reference points are taken. A centigrade (Celsius) thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as <span class="process-math">\(76 ^oC\text{.}\)</span> In the Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degrees Fahrenheit) of water. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as <span class="process-math">\(76 ^oF\text{.}\)</span> Kelvin scale (usually not called a thermometer) of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is <span class="process-math">\(273.15 \)</span> units cooler than it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> Kelvin is equivalent to a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(-273.15 ^oC\text{.}\)</span> Traditionally, a degree symbol is not assigned to the Kelvin scale. So, a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin and not 300 degrees Kelvin. Hence 300 Kelvin is abbreviated as <span class="process-math">\(300 K\text{.}\)</span> Conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below. The figure below shows Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scale thermometers.</div>
