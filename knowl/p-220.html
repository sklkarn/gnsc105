<div class="para">As we know now that the most materials change their volume on heating. We are using such property of materials to design thermometers to measure the temperature of a body. Depending on which state of substance is being used in thermometer, thermometers are given their name. For example: If we use solid substance in the termometer, then thermometers are called solid state thermometer. Platinum resistance thermometer, thermometer strip on the wall of aquarium, etc. If liquid is used in a thermometer, then it is called a liquid thermometer. Mercury thermometer, alcohol thermometer, etc. If gas is used then thermometer is called gas thermometer. Hydrogen gas thermometer, hilium gas thermometer, nitrogen gas thermometer, etc.</div>
