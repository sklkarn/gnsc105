</h3>The Mesozoic era is the era of geological time that spans from about 252 to 66 million years ago. It is also referred to as the Age of Reptiles because dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine reptiles dominated the planet during this time. The Mesozoic era is divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. During the Triassic period, life on land began to recover from the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which had wiped out about 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. During the Jurassic period, dinosaurs became more dominant, and the first birds evolved. The Cretaceous period saw the evolution of many new types of dinosaurs, including the tyrannosaurs and the ceratopsians. The end of the Mesozoic era is marked by the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out the dinosaurs and many other species. This event has been dated to about 66 million years ago using radiometric dating, and it is thought to have been caused by a massive asteroid impact. The extinction of the dinosaurs paved the way for the evolution of mammals and ultimately led to the emergence of modern terrestrial ecosystems.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-histgeol.html#li-983" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
