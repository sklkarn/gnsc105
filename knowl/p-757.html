<div class="para">An earthquake  is a sudden and violent shaking of the Earth's surface, caused by the rapid release of energy stored in the Earth's crust. This energy is typically released along a <dfn class="terminology">fault</dfn>, which is a fracture in the Earth's crust where the two sides have moved relative to each other. Earthquakes can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small tremors that are barely noticeable to massive earthquakes that can cause widespread destruction and loss of life. The size of an earthquake is measured on the <dfn class="terminology">Richter scale</dfn>,  which is a logarithmic scale <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-richter.html" title="Figure 11.3.4.(c)">FigureÂ 11.3.4.(c)</a> that assigns a numerical value to the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale ranges from zero to 8.9. An earthquake of 4.0 or below is miner and go without noticing most often. 5.0 to 6.0 Richtor scale is moderate. 7.0 and over is major earthquake. Richter scale of 6.0 is 10 times more severe than one at 5.0 and one at 7.0 is 100 times more severe than 5.0. Earthquakes can occur anywhere in the world, but are most common along the boundaries of tectonic plates, where the movement of plates can cause stress and strain to build up in the crust. When this stress is released suddenly, it causes the ground to shake and can also trigger other geological events such as landslides, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.</div>
