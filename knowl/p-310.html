<div class="para">Transformer is an electrical appliance which convert large current at low voltage to low current at high voltage, and vice versa. It uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to transform electrical energy from one circuit to another one. An AC current is needed to operate transformer. In AC current direction of current is keep changing which changes the magnetic field generated in the primary coil of transformer. Such changing magnetic field induces the current in the secondary coil of transformer. A typical transformer consists of a two or more coils of insulated wire wound on a laminated iron core. An alternating (AC) voltage which is to be reduced or increased is connected to the coil, called the primary coil or input coil. This coil magnetizes the iron core. A voltage is then induced in the other coil, called the secondary or output coil. The change of voltage (or voltage ratio) between the primary and secondary depends on the turns ratio of their two coils.</div>

If the number of turns in primary coil is less than that at secondary then it is called a step-up transformer and if number of turns in primary is grater than that in secondary then it is called a step-down transformer. Transformer transfers an electrical power from primary coil to secondary coil hence it also obeys the principle of conservation of energy. That is,</div>
