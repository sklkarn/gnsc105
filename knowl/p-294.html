<div class="para">Consider these thermometers are put into three cups of coffee with the same temperature. Where the Celsius thermometer reads a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(^oC\text{,}\)</span>  the Fahrenheit thermometer reads a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(^oF\text{,}\)</span>  and a Kelvin scale reads a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span>  then we can find their relationship as follows. Let's take one unknown thermometer which has lower reference points marked as <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> (for freezing point of water) and upper reference point marked as <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> (for boiling point of water). When dipped into the identical cup of coffee, it reads the temperature as <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Hence we can note the temperature of coffee as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{X-L}{U-L}\text{.}\)</span> By comparing all the thermometers readings we get the relation as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{X-L}{U-L}\amp =\frac{F-32}{212-32} = \frac{C-0}{100-0} = \frac{K-273}{373-273}\\
or, \frac{F-32}{180} \amp  = \frac{C}{100} = \frac{K-273}{100}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\therefore \frac{F-32}{9} = \frac{C}{5} = \frac{K-273}{5}\tag{4.1.1}

<div class="para">This relation is very helpful in converting one unit of temprature into another one.</div>
