<div class="para">Sediment deposition sites refer to locations where sediment is deposited and accumulates over time. Sediments can come from a variety of sources, including erosion of rock and soil, volcanic activity, and human activities such as mining, construction, and agriculture. One common type of sediment deposition site is a delta, which is an area where a river or stream enters a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Coastal areas can also be sediment deposition sites, where sediment is deposited by ocean currents and waves. This can lead to the formation of beaches, sand dunes, and other coastal landforms.</div>
