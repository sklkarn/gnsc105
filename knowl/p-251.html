<div class="para">The nature of gas is completely different than solids and liquids. Gas tskes up the entire volume of the container and can be compressed easily. Gas pressure increase or decrease as the temperature of the container change. It diffuses (or leaks out) to air if the container is left open. On such experiences, <em class="emphasis">Kinetic theory of gas</em> is developed to explain the nature of heat and the motion of particles associated with heat energy. According to this theory, gas is composed of large number of very tiny particles called molecules. These molecules are always in random motion with all possible directions and speeds which increases with the increase of temperature. In gases, the molecules are very far away from each other than in solids and liquids and have negligibly small force of attraction between them. Hence they can move freely anywhere within the available space. This explains why a gas has no definite shape and size. To understand the more general behavior of gases kinetic theory of ideal gases is postulated as</div>

<li><div class="para">All gases are made up of molecules. Molecules are identical, rigid, and perfectly elastic moving in random directions with all possible velocities.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The molecules are very far away from each other but they collide with each other and with walls of the container.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">All the collisions are elastic, but time spent during each collision is negligibly small compared to the time spent between the collisions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Molecules do not interact with each other (no intermolecular force of attraction) except during a collision.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The average kinetic energy of the molecules of any gas depends only on the temperature.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas of negligible molecular size and have no interactions among their molecules. In practice, a very dilute gas with extremely large volume of container space can be considered as an ideal gas. Remember the real gas molecules has definite size and may interact with each other. Hence this postulates are just a very simplified model to understand gas laws and need modification for real gas behaviors.
