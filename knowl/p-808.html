<div class="para">Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems that are built by colonies of small organisms called coral polyps. Coral reefs are found in shallow, clear waters, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They are important because they provide habitat for a diverse array of marine species, and they also provide a natural barrier that protects coastal areas from storms and erosion. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to changes in water temperature, acidity, and pollution, which can cause coral bleaching and damage to the entire ecosystem.</div>
