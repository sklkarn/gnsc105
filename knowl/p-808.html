<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Coriolis effect</dfn>  is a phenomenon that occurs due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. It causes moving objects, including air and water, to appear to veer off course from their straight-line motion. The Coriolis effect is caused by the Earthâ€™s rotation, which causes points on the equator to move at a faster speed than points closer to the poles. As a result, when air or water moves from one latitude to another, it appears to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is due to the conservation of angular momentum, which causes the moving air or water to maintain its original speed and direction of motion as it moves across different latitudes. The Coriolis effect has important implications for weather patterns and ocean currents. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect causes air to rotate clockwise around areas of high pressure and counterclockwise around areas of low pressure. In the Southern Hemisphere, the rotation is opposite. Similarly, ocean currents in the Northern Hemisphere tend to flow to the right of their intended path, while those in the Southern Hemisphere tend to flow to the left. The Coriolis effect is also responsible for the formation of tropical cyclones, which are rotating storms that form over warm ocean waters. The rotation of the Earth causes these storms to spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.</div>
