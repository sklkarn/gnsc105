<div class="para">The temperature profile of atmosphere is given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atmlayer.html" title="Figure 10.0.1.(a)">FigureÂ 10.0.1.(a)</a>. In troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude and air is heated from the ground up. On average the atmosphere in this layer is slightly unstable. Generally, air density in the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude. Troposphere has the most densly layer of air. In stratosphere, temperature increases with altitude. The temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere because of the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ozone <span class="process-math">\((O_3)\)</span> molecules. The air density in the stratosphere is much lower than in the troposphere, and it decreases gradually with increasing altitude. In mesosphere, temperature decreases with altitude and air density is even lower than in the stratosphere, and it decreases rapidly with increasing altitude. In thermosphere, temperature is very dependent on solar activity. It is the layer of the atmosphere which is first exposed to the Sun's radiation. In this layer, air density is extremely low, and it decreases exponentially with increasing altitude.</div>
