<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">solution</dfn>  is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. The substance that dissolves is called the <dfn class="terminology">solute</dfn>,  and the substance that does the dissolving is called the <dfn class="terminology">solvent</dfn>.  When the solute dissolves in the solvent, the resulting solution is a uniform mixture, called solution.</div>

<div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Solubility</dfn>  is the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent to form a solution. The solubility of a substance depends on various factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the solute and solvent. In general, "<em class="alert">like dissolves like</em>," meaning that substances with similar chemical properties tend to dissolve in each other. The amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent is limited by the solubility of the solute in the solvent. When a solution contains the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in the solvent at a given temperature and pressure, is said to be a <dfn class="terminology">saturated</dfn>  solution. If more solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve and will form a separate phase, such as a solid precipitate or gas bubbles.</div>
