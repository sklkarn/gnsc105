</h3>Displacement: It is a direct distance between initial and final position of the object. It is the shortest path between initial and final positions of the object. It has the same unit as distance. It is a vector quantity because it has only one particular direction between the initial and position of the object. Let's understand by the example here, suppose you started travelling from initial point A and reached to point B by travelling 4 m distance along east. Now from point B you covered a distance of 3 m along north to reach to your final point C. So the direct distance between your initial position and final position is 5m given by Pythagoras theorem along north-east.<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\therefore \quad Displacement, AC=\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=5m\text{.}
