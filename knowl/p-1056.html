<div class="para">Blackbody  radiation <a href="subsec_7bbr-subsection.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.1.1: Blackbody Radiation">Subsection 7.1.1</a> is an electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object that absorbs all the radiations incident upon it, and then emits radiation of all kind in thermal equilibrium. The spectrum of blackbody radiation depends only on the temperature of the object [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bbr.html" title="Figure 7.1.2">Figure 7.1.2</a>], but not on its composition or other properties. The spectrum of blackbody radiation can be described by Planck’s law, which relates the energy density of radiation at a given wavelength to the temperature of the emitting object. As the temperature increases, the peak wavelength of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the total amount of radiation emitted increases. By analyzing the spectrum of an object, astronomers can determine its composition, temperature, and other physical properties. When a star emits light, it produces a continuous spectrum of blackbody radiation that is modified by absorption lines caused by the presence of specific chemical elements in the star’s atmosphere.</div>
