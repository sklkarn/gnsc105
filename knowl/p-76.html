<dfn class="terminology">Friction:</dfn> Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called <em class="emphasis">static friction</em>. This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called <em class="emphasis">kinetic friction</em>. This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(f \propto N \)</span> or,</div>

\begin{equation}
f = \mu N\text{.}\tag{2.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Where proportionality constant <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span> is called the coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces of contact. Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence.</div>
