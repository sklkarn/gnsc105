<div class="para">Atomic theory is the foundation of modern chemistry and provides a basic understanding of the nature of matter. The theory states that all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element. <em class="emphasis">Atoms are indivisible:</em> Atoms are the smallest units of matter that can exist and cannot be broken down into smaller units. <em class="emphasis">Atoms are identical:</em> Atoms of the same element are identical and have the same number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. <em class="emphasis">Atoms have structure:</em> Atoms have a small central nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons in shells. <em class="emphasis">Atoms are arranged in the periodic table:</em> Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons, electrons, and neutrons and are arranged in the periodic table according to their atomic number, which is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. <em class="emphasis">Atoms can bond to form molecules:</em> Atoms can bond together to form molecules by sharing or exchanging electrons. The properties of molecules are determined by the type of atoms and the way they are bonded together. <em class="emphasis">Atoms can be ionized:</em> Atoms can gain or lose electrons to become positively or negatively charged ions. Ions play an important role in many chemical reactions.</div>
