<div class="para">The acronym <dfn class="terminology">LASER</dfn>  stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The light  emitted  from  a  laser is distinctly monochromatic compared to the light emiited from lightbulb or the sun. It is spatially and temporally coherent to a much higher degree than other light sources. Hence, the laser is a concentrated beam of light through the process of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. Lasers have a wide range of applications in fields such as medicine, communications, manufacturing, and entertainment. They work by emitting a narrow, intense beam of light that can be precisely controlled and directed, making them useful for tasks that require high precision or intense light. Here are some important processes that make laser a very important tool. <dfn class="terminology">Light emission:</dfn> Lasers emit light at a specific wavelength, which is determined by the laser material used. This narrow spectral width makes the light highly collimated and monochromatic, meaning it has a single wavelength and travels in a straight path. <dfn class="terminology">Stimulated emission:</dfn> Lasers rely on the process of stimulated emission to produce light. This involves the absorption of energy by a material, followed by the release of that energy in the form of a photon. The photon then triggers the emission of additional photons, creating a chain reaction that results in the intense beam of light. <dfn class="terminology">Active medium:</dfn> The active medium is the material that produces the laser light. It can be a solid, liquid, or gas, and it is chosen based on the desired wavelength and type of laser. <dfn class="terminology">Pumping:</dfn> The active medium must be excited, or “pumped,” to generate the laser light. This can be done through electrical means, or by shining a light on the medium. <dfn class="terminology">Reflective cavity:</dfn> The laser light is contained within a reflective cavity, which is formed by two mirrors facing each other. The light bounces back and forth between the mirrors, amplifying and intensifying the beam as it passes through the active medium. <dfn class="terminology">Output coupler:</dfn> One of the mirrors is partially transparent, allowing some of the laser light to escape and form the laser beam. <dfn class="terminology">Population inversion:</dfn> is a key concept in laser physics and refers to the state of a group of atoms in the active medium of a laser. Normally, the majority of atoms in a material are in the lowest energy state (ground state), and a small fraction are in excited states. In a population inversion, the situation is reversed, with the majority of atoms being in excited states and a small fraction in the ground state. This condition is necessary for a laser to produce light, as it provides the necessary amount of excited atoms that can undergo stimulated emission, releasing photons that amplify and produce the laser beam. The pumping process is responsible for creating the population inversion in the active medium. In summary, population inversion is the requirement for laser light generation, as it provides the necessary population of excited atoms to produce the beam of light through stimulated emission. <a class="external" href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/lasers/latest/lasers.html?simulation=lasers" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">LASER</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-31-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>
