<div class="para">Orsted discovered that electric currents can produce magnetic fields and Faraday discovered that magnetic fields can be used to induce electric currents in a circuit. A moving electrical charge also generates a magnetic field just as changing magnetic field induces current in a conductor. In fact, a traditional magnet is the result of individual motion of electrons within the atoms of the magnet. These atoms are so aligned that magnetic field procduced by their electrons are pointed along a uniform direction giving rise to a mangetic field of the magnet. In non-magnetic materials, the electrons move in such a way that the individual magnetic fields point in different directions, so they cancel each other out and the net magnetic field generated is negligible. In normal condition, magnetic fields of the magnetic material are distributed in groups of small region, called <em class="emphasis">domain</em> and magnetic fields of each domain are oriented in different directions to cancel each other effect. This is why iron is just a piece of metal bar unless it is magnetized.</div>
