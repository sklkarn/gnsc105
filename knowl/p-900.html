<dfn class="terminology">Limestone</dfn> is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate (<span class="process-math">\(CaCO_3\)</span>). It forms from the accumulation of shells, coral, and other marine debris, as well as from the precipitation of calcium carbonate from water. Limestone is typically light-colored and can have a wide range of textures, from fine-grained to coarsely crystalline. It is often used as a building material and in the production of cement, lime, and other industrial materials. Limestone is also used as a decorative stone in landscaping and architecture, and can be carved into sculptures and other works of art. Some types of limestone, such as dolomite and travertine, can be formed by chemical precipitation from groundwater, rather than by the accumulation of marine debris. Limestone is vulnerable to weathering and erosion, and can be dissolved by acidic water or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, forming features such as caves, sinkholes, and limestone pavements.</div>
