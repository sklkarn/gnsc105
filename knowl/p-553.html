<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-spectlines.html" title="Figure 7.1.5.(b)">FigureÂ 7.1.5.(b)</a> the numbers on the left side represent energy levels with the lowest energy level at the bottom and on right side representing their corresponding values. The arrows represent all possible transitions of electron from one energy level to another. Each group of transitions is given the name of the scientist who identified their origin. Longer arrow means more energy is released during transition and hence the light of shorter wavelength is being emitted. The Balmer series releases light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Lyman series, with longer arrows, requires the higher energy of the UV region. The Paschen, Brackett series, and Pfund series with shorter arrows require the lower energy of the IR region. According to Bohr model, Lyman series appears when electrons jump from higher energy levels <span class="process-math">\((n_h = 2,3,4,5,6,\cdots)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(n_l = 1\)</span> energy state. Balmer series appears when electrons jump from higher energy levels <span class="process-math">\((n_h = 3,4,5,6,\cdots)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(n_l = 2\)</span> energy state, and so on.</div>
