<dfn class="terminology">Melting point elevation</dfn> Melting point elevation is a colligative property of a solution that describes how the melting point of a solid solvent is increased when a solute is dissolved in it. Like freezing point depression, it is a property of solutions that depends on the concentration of solute particles in the solution, but not on the identity of the solute particles. When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, it disrupts the crystal lattice structure of the solvent, making it more difficult for the solvent molecules to transition from the solid to the liquid state. As a result, the melting point of the solution is higher than that of the pure solvent.</div>
