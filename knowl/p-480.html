<div class="para">Instead of three phases (or states) of matter, there are three different classes of matter based on its composition and properties. They are elements, compounds, and mixture.</div>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Elements:</dfn> An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by any chemical means. Elements are the building blocks of all matter and are composed of only one type of atom. Examples of elements include hydrogen, oxygen, and gold.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Compounds:</dfn>  A compound is a pure substance that is made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio. Compounds have different properties from their constituent elements and cannot be separated into their individual elements by physical means. Examples of compounds include water (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>), salt (<span class="process-math">\(NaCl\)</span>), and glucose (<span class="process-math">\(C_6H_{12}O_6\)</span>).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Mixtures:</dfn> A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in which each substance retains its own chemical properties. Mixtures can be separated into their individual components by physical means. There are two main types of mixtures: homogeneous mixtures, where the substances are evenly mixed, and heterogeneous mixtures, where the substances are not evenly mixed. Examples of mixtures include air, fruit juice, and concrete.</div></li>
