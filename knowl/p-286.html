<div class="para">When charge flows from one place to another, an electrical current is formed. An electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge. In other words, the flow of charge through any area of cross-section per unit time. If a net charge <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> passes through any cross-sectional area of a conductor in time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then the electric current is given by</div>

<div class="para">Its unit is Ampere, i.e. one ampere of current represents one coulomb of charge passes through a conductor in one second. It is a scalar quantity but its conventional direction of motion is taken as the direction of flow of positive charges. In conductor, current flows solely due to motion of electrons, hence the direction of current is opposite to electrons flow. From the law of conservation of charges current remains constant in a conductor irrespective of the local area of cross-section. When the direction of motion of charge does not change with time, the current is said to be direct current, or DC, but when the direction of motion of charges reverses periodically, the current is known as an alternating current, or AC. Current can only exist between two points of different potential (voltage) connected by a conductor and can only exist whenever a conductive path with no breaks is provided. Flow of charges is similar to flowing water in DC current. <a class="external" href="https://javalab.org/en/electric_current_en/" target="_blank">conductor &amp; insulator</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-12-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.2.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
