<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">The Spectrometer.</span></h4> <div class="para">A spectrometer is an instrument used in astronomy to measure the spectrum of light [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-spectrallines.html" title="Figure 7.1.6">Figure 7.1.6</a>] emitted by celestial objects. It breaks down the light into its constituent colors, or wavelengths, allowing astronomers to study the chemical composition, temperature, and other physical properties of the object. The spectrometer works by passing light through a prism or a diffraction grating, which separates the light into its different wavelengths. The resulting spectrum can be analyzed to determine the composition of the object emitting the light. Spectrometers can also be used to study the motion of celestial objects, as the Doppler shift of the spectral lines can provide information about the object’s velocity. There are several types of spectrometers used in astronomy, including optical, infrared, ultraviolet, and X-ray spectrometers. Each type is optimized to detect light within a specific range of wavelengths, allowing astronomers to study different types of celestial objects and phenomena. Spectrometers have played a critical role in advancing our understanding of the universe. They have helped astronomers discover new elements and compounds in stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, and have provided evidence for the Big Bang theory and other fundamental concepts in astrophysics.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_thirteenth-observ.html#paragraphs-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
