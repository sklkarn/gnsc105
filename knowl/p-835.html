<div class="para">Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun. There are millions of asteroids in our solar system, ranging in size from tiny pebbles to massive rocks several hundred kilometers across. Most asteroids are found in the <dfn class="terminology">asteroid belt</dfn>, [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-solarsys3.html" title="Figure 12.0.1.(a)">FigureÂ 12.0.1.(a)</a>] a region of space between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids are thought to be remnants from the early solar system, left over from the formation of the planets. Studying asteroids can give us insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system, as well as provide clues about the potential hazards that these objects pose to our planet. <dfn class="terminology">Meteoroids</dfn> can come from various sources, including the asteroid belt.  Small rocky objects in asteroids belt sometimes collide with each other and create meteoroids. However, meteoroids can also come from other sources, such as comets or other objects in space. Once a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is called a meteor or shooting star.</div>
