</h3>The Paleozoic era is a geological era that spanned from about 541 to 252 million years ago. It is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic eon, and it is divided into six periods: the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian periods. The Paleozoic era is characterized by significant geological and biological changes, including the emergence of complex multicellular life, the development of hard shells and skeletons, and the evolution of early fish, plants, and insects. The Cambrian explosion, which occurred during the Cambrian period, marked a rapid diversification of animal life, including the first appearance of many modern phyla. During the Paleozoic era, Earth's continents were united in the supercontinent of Pangaea, which began to break up during the Mesozoic era. The Paleozoic era ended with the Permian extinction event, which wiped out about 95% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. The cause of this extinction event is still debated, but it is thought to have been caused by a combination of volcanic activity, climate change, and asteroid impacts.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-histgeol.html#li-984" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
