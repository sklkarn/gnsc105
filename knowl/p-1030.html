<div class="para">The Sun is a complex and dynamic object that is composed of several distinct parts. Some of them are: <dfn class="terminology">Core:</dfn> The core is the central region of the Sun where nuclear fusion occurs. The temperature in the core is about 15 million degrees Celsius, and the pressure is about 250 billion times greater than the surface of the Earth. In the core, hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. <dfn class="terminology">Radiative Zone:</dfn> The radiative zone is the region of the Sun where energy is transported by photons (particles of light). The energy produced in the core travels outwards through the radiative zone over a period of about 100,000 years. <dfn class="terminology">Convective Zone:</dfn> The convective zone is the outermost layer of the Sun's interior. In this region, energy is transported by the movement of hot gas cells called convection cells. The convective zone is characterized by a boiling motion that is similar to water boiling in a pot. <dfn class="terminology">Photosphere:</dfn> The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun. This is where most of the light and heat that we receive on Earth originate. The temperature of the photosphere is about 5,500 degrees Celsius, and it appears as a bright, yellow disk in the sky. <dfn class="terminology">Chromosphere:</dfn> The chromosphere is the thin layer of gas above the photosphere. It is visible during a total solar eclipse as a reddish-pink ring around the Sun. The temperature of the chromosphere is about 4,000 to 20,000 degrees Celsius. <dfn class="terminology">Corona:</dfn> The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. It extends millions of kilometers into space and is visible during a total solar eclipse as a faint, white halo around the Sun. The temperature of the corona is several million degrees Celsius, much hotter than the surface of the Sun.</div>
