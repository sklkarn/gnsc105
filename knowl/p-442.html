<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Nucleus</dfn> of an atom refers to the central, positively charged part of an atom that contains protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons). The number of protons in the nucleus, known as the atomic number, determines the element to which the atom belongs. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons in orbital shells. The properties of an element are determined by the arrangement of its electrons and its atomic number. The nucleus of an atom is very small compared to the overall size of the atom, but contains most of the atom's mass. The strong force, also known as the nuclear force, holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. The nucleus can undergo various types of changes, such as fusion (combining of two nuclei) or fission (splitting of a nucleus). The study of atomic nuclei is called nuclear physics. The isotopes of an element are atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons in their nucleus.</div>
