<div class="para">It is a branch of physics which deals with magnets and magnetic properties of materials. It defines the magnetic behavior of material which is associated with the motion of electric charge. The motion of charges in a conductor or in space gives rise to magnetic fields and magnetism is a result of magnetic fields. The word ”magnet” is taken from the Latin word <span class="process-math">\(\mu \alpha \gamma \nu \eta' \tau \eta \zeta \)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lambda \iota \theta o \zeta \)</span> meaning stones from magnesia. ”Magnetis [líthos]” is a source of lodestones found in Manisa, Turkey. Magnetism is caused by moving charges and is experienced by moving charges. It is a phenomenon of materials by which they attract or repel other materials. The motion of an electron in an orbit around a nucleus or its spin on an axis produces a magnetic field.</div>
