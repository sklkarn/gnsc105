<div class="para">Meteorology is the study of the weather and climate. Meteorologists use a variety of tools and techniques to collect data on the atmosphere, including weather balloons, satellites, and radar. They analyze this data to create models and forecasts of weather patterns and atmospheric conditions. Weather forecasting is one of the most important applications of meteorology, as it provides critical information to help people prepare for severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards. Meteorologists also study long-term climate patterns and changes, which can help inform public policy decisions related to environmental protection and resource management. <dfn class="terminology">Weather</dfn> refers to the state of temperature, humidity, pressure, cloud formation, or precipitation at any given time. Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions of a specific place at a specific time.<dfn class="terminology">Climate</dfn> describes the summary of weather conditions for a specific region over a fairly long time period.
