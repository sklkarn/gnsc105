<div class="para">In this case, volume of displaced liquid is equal to the volume of submerged portion of the object. On this basis, we can tell that if the density of an object is greater than that of fluid, it sinks. If object density is equal to the density of fluid, then object submerges. If object density is less than the density of fluid, then object floats. To make iron ship not to sink in water, it is made with wide surface area and its body is like a hollow shell, so that the density of entire ship is less than the density of water.</div>
