<div class="para">The  most widely accepted theory is that moon was <em class="emphasis">formed as a result of a giant impact <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-moonform.html" title="Figure 12.2.3">Figure 12.2.3</a> between Earth and a Mars-sized object called Theia</em>, early in the history of the solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago. According to this theory, the impact would have melted both the Earth and Theia, and a large amount of debris would have been ejected into space. This debris eventually coalesced to form the Moon. The evidence for this theory comes from the fact that the Moon’s composition is very similar to that of Earth’s mantle, suggesting that it was formed from material that originated from Earth. Another piece of evidence for the giant impact theory is that the Moon has a lower density than Earth, which suggests that it is composed of lighter materials. The impact would have caused a lot of the heavier materials to sink into the Earth, leaving behind a lighter mixture of materials that eventually formed the Moon. While the giant impact theory is currently the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the Moon, there are other competing theories that propose different mechanisms for the Moon’s formation. These include ideas such as the capture of a passing object by Earth’s gravity, or the fission of a rapidly spinning Earth. However, these theories are generally considered to be less likely than the giant impact theory.</div>
