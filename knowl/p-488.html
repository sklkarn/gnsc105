<dfn class="terminology">Molecule:</dfn> A molecule is the smallest unit of a substance that retains the chemical properties of that substance and can exist as a separate entity. It is composed of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. In a molecule, the atoms are held together by chemical bonds, which are formed by the sharing or exchange of electrons between the atoms. The type of bonds and the arrangement of atoms in a molecule determine the chemical and physical properties of the substance. Molecules can be formed from a single type of atom, such as a molecule of oxygen (<span class="process-math">\(O_2\)</span>), or from different types of atoms, such as a molecule of water (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>). The number of atoms in a molecule and the type of atoms can also vary, giving rise to a vast array of different molecules, each with its own unique properties. Molecules are the building blocks of matter and play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes, including chemical reactions, phase transitions, and the formation of materials. A deep understanding of the structure and properties of molecules is essential for many scientific and engineering disciplines, including chemistry, biology, materials science, and environmental science.</div>
