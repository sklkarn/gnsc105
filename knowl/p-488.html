<div class="para">In <dfn class="terminology">heterogeneous mixture</dfn> substances are not evenly mixed and have different compositions in different parts of the mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are easy to identify, as the individual substances are easily visible and can be separated from one another by physical means. Here are some examples of heterogeneous mixtures: <em class="emphasis">Fruit salad:</em> A mixture of fruit, such as apples, bananas, and grapes, cut into pieces and combined in a bowl is a heterogeneous mixture. Each piece of fruit has its own unique composition, and the composition of the mixture changes from one part of the mixture to another. <em class="emphasis">Granola:</em> A mixture of oats, nuts, dried fruit, and sweeteners is a heterogeneous mixture, as the ingredients are not evenly mixed and the composition of the mixture changes from one part of the mixture to another. <em class="emphasis">Sand and water:</em> A mixture of sand and water is a heterogeneous mixture, as the sand particles settle to the bottom of the container and the water is clear. The composition of the mixture changes from the top of the mixture to the bottom. <em class="emphasis">Soil:</em> Soil is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, air, and water, and is a heterogeneous mixture as the composition of the soil changes from one part of the soil to another. <em class="emphasis">Concrete:</em> Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, gravel, and water, and is a heterogeneous mixture, as the composition of the concrete changes f rom one part of the mixture to another.</div>
