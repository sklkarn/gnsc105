<div class="para">A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, and other celestial objects that are held together by gravity. Galaxies come in a variety of shapes and sizes [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-typesofgalax.html" title="Figure 14.1.1.(a)">FigureÂ 14.1.1.(a)</a>], ranging from small dwarf galaxies to giant elliptical galaxies. The Milky Way, which is the galaxy that contains our solar system, is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years and contains hundreds of billions of stars. Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe, and studying them can provide insights into the evolution and structure of the cosmos.</div>
