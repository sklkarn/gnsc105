<li><div class="para">Distance: It is the length between the change in positions of an object. If <span class="process-math">\(x_{i}\)</span> is an initial position of the object and <span class="process-math">\(x_{f}\)</span> is a final position of that object then <span class="process-math">\(x_{f}-x_{i} =d, \)</span> is the distance travelled by the object. It is a scalar quantity because it does not deal with the direction in which the object is travelling.It's unit is <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> in SI system and <span class="process-math">\(cm\)</span> in CGS system, and <span class="process-math">\(ft\)</span> in FPS system.</div></li>
<li>Displacement: It is a direct distance between initial and final position of the object. It is the shortest path between initial and final positions of the object. It has the same unit as distance. It is a vector quantity because it has only one particular direction between the initial and position of the object. Let's understand by the example here, suppose you started travelling from initial point A and reached to point B by travelling 4 m distance along east. Now from point B you covered a distance of 3 m along north to reach to your final point C. So the direct distance between your initial position and final position is 5m given by Pythagoras theorem along north-east.<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\therefore \quad Displacement, AC=\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=5m\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<li><div class="para">Speed:The rate of change of position of an object is called a speed. It states that how fast the object is changing its position with respedt to time. In physics, the rate means with respect to time. It is also a scalar quantity. speed is represented by the letter, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x_{i}\)</span> is an initial position and <span class="process-math">\(x_{f}\)</span> is the final position of the object then<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i} = \frac{d}{t}\text{.}\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>It's unit is m/s in SI system and cm/s in CGS system, and ft/s in FPS system.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Velocity: It is the speed of an object in particular direction. It is a vector quantity. It has the same unit as speed. It is also represented by the letter, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity is called an acceleration. It states that how fast the velocity of an object is being changed. It is also a vector quantity. If <span class="process-math">\(v_{i}\)</span> is an initial velocity and <span class="process-math">\(v_{f}\)</span> is the final velocity of the object then the acceleration of the object is given by<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
a=\frac{v_f-v_i}{t_f-t_i} = \frac{v}{t}\text{.}\tag{2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>It's unit is <span class="process-math">\(m/s^2\)</span> in SI system. If acceleration is positive then the object is speeding up, if it is negative then the object is slowing down, if it is zero then the object is either moving with uniform velocity or remains at rest. <dfn class="terminology">Note:</dfn> Velocity is always in the same direction as the object is moving, but the acceleration is not.</div></li>
