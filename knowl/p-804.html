<div class="para">Temperature differences on the different parts of earth create the pressure difference which make air to flow. For example, the equator receives more direct sunlight and is therefore warmer than the poles, creating a temperature gradient that drives the movement of air from the equator towards the poles. This creates the global circulation patterns of the atmosphere. Local temperature differences can also create wind patterns, such as sea breezes and land breezes. During the day, land heats up more quickly than water, creating an area of low pressure over the land. The cooler, higher-pressure air over the ocean moves towards the land, creating a sea breeze. At night, the situation is reversed, with the land cooling down more quickly than the ocean and creating a high-pressure area. This causes the air to move from the land towards the ocean, creating a land breeze.</div>
