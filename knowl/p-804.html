<div class="para">Winds  are primarily caused by differences in temperature and pressure between different parts of Earthâ€™s atmosphere. When air is heated, it becomes less dense and rises, creating an area of low pressure. Conversely, when air cools, it becomes more dense and sinks, creating an area of high pressure. This movement of air from high pressure to low pressure creates winds, which can be influenced by the rotation of the Earth and other factors such as the presence of mountains and oceans.</div>
