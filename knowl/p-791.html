<dfn class="terminology">Ozone</dfn>  is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms <span class="process-math">\((O_3)\)</span> and is an important component of the Earth’s atmosphere. It is a highly reactive gas and is often referred to as a <em class="emphasis">reactive oxygen species</em>. Ozone absorbs and filters harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the sun to enter earth troposhphere. UV radiation can cause skin cancer and other health problems. The <dfn class="terminology">ozonosphere</dfn>, also known as the ozone layer, is a region of the Earth’s stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone. It is located approximately 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. The release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other pollutants into the atmosphere cause the depletion of the ozone layer which is a significant environmental concern.</div>
