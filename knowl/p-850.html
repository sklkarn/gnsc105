<div class="para">Jupiter [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-jupiter.html" title="Figure 12.1.6">FigureÂ 12.1.6</a>] is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is located between the orbits of Mars and Saturn. It has a diameter of 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers) and is a gas giant planet, meaning that it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gas, with no solid surface. Jupiter is known for its distinctive colorful bands of clouds, which are caused by strong winds in its atmosphere that blow in opposite directions at different latitudes. It also has a giant <dfn class="terminology">red spot</dfn>, a massive storm that has been raging for over 300 years. Jupiter's strong gravitational pull has also led to the discovery of many small, rocky asteroids and comets that are captured in its orbit. Jupiter has been studied extensively by spacecraft, including NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 missions, as well as the Galileo spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 1995 to 2003. The Juno spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2011, is currently in orbit around Jupiter, studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure.</div>
