<div class="para">Learning skills by memorization cannot work efficiently in learning physical sciences. It is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into ten chapters that covers the syllabus of physical science at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. The topics in this book have been carefully selected to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of science and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to inform how to investigate and approach problems in introductory level sciences. This book strives to guide readers to learn physical science in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.</div>
