<dfn class="terminology">Sedimentary rocks</dfn> are formed from the accumulation and cementation of sedimentary particles such as sand, silt, and clay. It is formed in layers. Examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, shale, and limestone. Sedimentary rocks cover about 75% of the Earth’s surface, and they are the most common type of rock found at the Earth’s surface. Sedimentary rocks provide clues about the Earth’s history, such as the type of environment in which they were formed and the types of organisms that lived during that time. For example, fossils found in sedimentary rocks provide valuable information about the evolution of life on Earth. Sedimentary rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals and resources, such as oil, gas, and coal. <dfn class="terminology">Fragmental and conglomerate</dfn> sedimentary rocks are  formed from the accumulation and lithification of rock fragments and other debris.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-1005" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
