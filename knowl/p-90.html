<em class="alert">Newtonâ€™s first law</em> is the definition of a force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in uniform motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied to it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion. The first law is also called a <dfn class="terminology">law of inertia</dfn>. Inertia is an ability of an object to resist any changes in its motion. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change the state of rest or motion of an object. <dfn class="terminology">Mass:</dfn> It is the amount of matter contained in an object. It is also reposible for the force of gravity of the object.</div>
