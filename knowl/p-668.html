<div class="para">When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back into space, and some is absorbed by the Earth's surface, which then radiates it back into the atmosphere as heat. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb some of this heat energy and re-emit it in all directions, including back to the Earth's surface. As a result, the greenhouse gases act like a blanket that traps some of the heat energy and prevents it from escaping into space. This causes the Earth's temperature to be warmer than it would be otherwise, which is necessary for life as we know it to exist on the planet. The energy of light is given by <span class="process-math">\(E=hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\)</span>  where <span class="process-math">\(h=6.67\times 10^{34} Js\)</span> is Planck's constant, <span class="process-math">\(c=3\times 10^8 m/s\)</span> is velocity of light, and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is wavelength of the light. Suppose  <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is the wavelength of light of energy <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> coming from the sun's visible light to the earth. When the light eneters into the earth atmosphere and it gets absorbed by the atmospheric gases, plants, and the earth's surface but when it remits and reflects back from the earth surface towards the space it losses some of its energy and becomes less energetic <span class="process-math">\(E' = \frac{hc}{\lambda'}\)</span> to penetrate our atmosphere except that some amount of light energy is able to penetrate the atmosphere that makes our earth warmer as a suitable place to survive life. However, due to increasing population, deforestation, and industrialization the amount of greenhouse gases are increasing making more difficult to the less energetic light rays to leave our atmosphere. Such activities are leading the <dfn class="terminology">global warming</dfn>.</div>
