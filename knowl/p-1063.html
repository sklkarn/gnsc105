<div class="para">A supernova  is a powerful and catastrophic explosion that occurs when a star reaches the end of its life. Supernovae can release an enormous amount of energy, equivalent to the energy emitted by an entire galaxy. There are two main types of supernovae: <dfn class="terminology">Type Ia supernovae</dfn> are thought to occur when a white dwarf star in a binary system accretes matter from its companion star, eventually reaching a critical mass and exploding. Type Ia supernovae are important for measuring cosmic distances because they have a relatively consistent and predictable brightness. <dfn class="terminology">Type II supernovae</dfn> occur when a massive star runs out of fuel for nuclear fusion in its core and collapses under its own gravity. The core of the star becomes incredibly dense and hot, leading to a rapid release of energy that produces a powerful explosion. Type II supernovae can leave behind a <dfn class="terminology">neutron star or a black hole</dfn>. Supernovae are important for a number of reasons. They are responsible for the production of heavy elements such as iron and gold, which are essential for life as we know it. Supernovae can also trigger the formation of new stars and planetary systems. Additionally, the energy and material released by supernovae can have a significant impact on their surrounding environment, including the formation of nebulae <a href="subsec-nebula.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 14.1.5: Nebulae">SubsectionÂ 14.1.5</a> and the acceleration of cosmic rays.</div>
