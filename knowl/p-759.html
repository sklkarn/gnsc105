The history of the Earth is divided into four eons: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons. The Hadean eon represents the earliest period of Earth's history, from the formation of the planet about 4.6 billion years ago to about 4 billion years ago. The Hadean eon is characterized by intense volcanic activity, meteorite impacts, and the formation of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The Archean eon follows the Hadean eon and spans from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. During the Archean eon, the first life forms evolved, including the earliest prokaryotic cells. The Proterozoic eon follows the Archean eon and spans from about 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago. During the Proterozoic eon, the first eukaryotic cells and multicellular organisms evolved, and oxygen levels in the atmosphere rose significantly. The Phanerozoic eon is the most recent eon and spans from about 541 million years ago to the present day. The Phanerozoic eon is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. During the Phanerozoic eon, complex life forms, such as fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds, evolved and diversified, and the Earth underwent significant geological changes, such as the formation and breakup of supercontinents.</div>
