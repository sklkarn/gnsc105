<em class="emphasis">Some examples of I law:</em> 1. When the bus driver abruptly applies the breaks, passengers tend to feel a momentary pull in the forward direction. The reason behind this jerk felt by the passengers sitting inside the bus is the law of inertia. Due to inertia, our upper body part continues to maintain a state of motion even after the bus stops, thereby pushing us in the forward direction. 2. A book kept on a bookshelf does not change its shape, size, or position until acted upon by an external force. 3. A runner is not able to stop himself right after crossing the finish line. He/She tends to take time and cover a few meters of distance running beyond the finish line. This is because the inertia of motion resists a sudden termination of motion and compels the body to maintain its state of motion.</div>
