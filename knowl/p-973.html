<div class="para">Venus rotates very slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is longer than it takes for Venus to complete one orbit around the Sun (which takes about 225 Earth days). As a result, Venus has a very unusual day and night cycle. On Venus, a single day (one complete rotation) lasts longer than a year (one orbit around the Sun). This means that a day on Venus lasts about 117 Earth days, while a night on Venus also lasts about 117 Earth days. However, it's important to note that the atmosphere of Venus is very thick and opaque, which makes it difficult to define day and night in the same way we do on Earth. Instead, Venus experiences a kind of "twilight" all the time, with the level of light varying depending on the location and altitude in the atmosphere.</div>
