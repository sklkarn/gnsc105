<dfn class="terminology">Comets</dfn> are celestial bodies that orbit the sun and are primarily composed of ice, dust, and rock [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-Hale-Bopp.html" title="Figure 12.1.3.(a)">Figure 12.1.3.(a)</a>]. They are often referred to as "dirty snowballs" because of their composition. When a comet approaches the sun, its ice begins to vaporize, releasing gas and dust that form a glowing coma, a temporary atmosphere around the nucleus. The solar wind and radiation pressure from the sun cause the coma to form a <em class="emphasis">tail</em> that points away from the sun. Comets can have highly elliptical orbits [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cometorbt.html" title="Figure 12.1.3.(b)">Figure 12.1.3.(b)</a>] that take them far from the sun and then back towards it, sometimes taking thousands of years to complete a single orbit. Many comets are believed to originate in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune that contains icy bodies and small planets. Some comets have been known to collide with planets or moons, and these collisions can have significant impacts on the celestial body's surface. Comets have fascinated people for centuries and have been the subject of many myths and legends. They have also been studied extensively by astronomers, who use them as a tool to study the formation and evolution of the solar system.</div>
