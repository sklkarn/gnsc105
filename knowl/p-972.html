<div class="para">Mercury is tidally locked to the Sun, which means that the same side of Mercury always faces the Sun. This is because of its day and year period. Mercury takes about 59 earth days to complete one rotation on its axis. That is Mercury's rotational period (day) is approximately 176 Earth days, which is about 2/3 of its year (orbital period around the Sun). This means that one day on Mercury (one complete rotation on its axis) takes about 176 Earth days, while one year on Mercury (one complete orbit around the Sun) takes about 88 Earth days.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
88\times 2/3 = 58.67 \approx 59 days

<div class="para">Mercury's surface is rocky and heavily cratered, with vast plains, mountains, and cliffs. Its surface features are similar to those of our Moon, with large impact craters, smooth plains, and steep cliffs. However, Mercury's surface is more diverse and complex than the Moon's surface. One of the most prominent features on Mercury is the Caloris Basin, a large impact crater that measures about 1,550 kilometers in diameter. The basin is surrounded by a ring of mountains and contains a variety of geological features, such as smooth plains, chaotic terrain, and scarps. Mercury also has many other large impact craters, such as the Rembrandt Basin and the Beethoven Basin, which are some of the largest impact basins in the solar system.</div>
