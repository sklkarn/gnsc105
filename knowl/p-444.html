<dfn class="terminology">Thomson's atomic model</dfn> was proposed in 1904. It was based on his discovery of the electron, a negatively charged particle within the atom. According to Thomson's model, the atom was a sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded within it like raisins in a pudding. Hence this model is also known as "plum pudding" model. This model was later modified by Rutherford's atomic model.</div>
