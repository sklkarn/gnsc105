<div class="para">The binding energy of a nucleus determines its stability against disintegration. The larger the binding energy, the more stable is the nucleus and vice a versa. The binding energy per nucleon, BE/A = Binding energy of the nucleus  / Total number of nucleons. It is found that the binding energy per nucleon varies from element to element. A graph  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bepn.html" title="Figure 7.2.4">FigureÂ 7.2.4</a> is plotted with the mass number A of the nucleus along the X-axis and binding energy per nucleon along the Y-axis. The binding energy per nucleon increases sharply with mass number A upto 20. It increases slowly after <span class="process-math">\(A = 20\text{.}\)</span> The curve becomes almost flat for mass number between 40 and 120. Beyond 120, it decreases slowly as A increases. The  binding  energy  per  nucleon  reaches  a maximum at A=56, corresponding to the iron nucleus (<span class="process-math">\({}_{26}^{56}Fe\)</span>). Hence, iron has the most stable nucleus. At the lower end of the curve, smaller nuclei have relatively lower binding energy per nucleon compared to larger nuclei. This is because the attractive strong nuclear force, which holds the nucleons together, decreases rapidly with increasing distance between the nucleons. As a result, small nuclei tend to be less stable and more likely to undergo nuclear reactions, such as beta decay. At the higher end of the curve, larger nuclei have relatively lower binding energy per nucleon compared to smaller nuclei. This is because the repulsive electromagnetic force between the positively charged protons in the nucleus increases with increasing number of protons. This repulsive force limits the size of the nucleus and causes it to become less stable.</div>
