<div class="para">Conservation of angular momentum tells that in rotaiton, initial angular momentum is always equal to final angular momentum of the body if no external torque is acting on it. That is <span class="process-math">\(L_1=L_2\)</span> or, <span class="process-math">\(I_1\omega_1 = I_2\omega_2\text{.}\)</span> If the moment of inertia of a rotaing body decreases then rotational velocity is going to increase. For example: 1. when ice skaters spin by pulling their arms inwards their rotational speed increase but their rotational speed decrease when they stretched their arms outwards. 2. A system of planets orbiting around a star has no net external torque acting, so its angular momentum is constant. Hence, when a planet travels along an elliptical orbit, its speed reduces when it is further away from the star and its speed increases as it approaches the star <a class="external" href="https://physics.weber.edu/amiri/director-dcrversion/newversion/kepler/Kepler_1.2.html" target="_blank">star-planet system</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.
