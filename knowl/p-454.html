<div class="para">In nuclear fission reaction neutron is absorbed by unstable nucleus and get splitted into two or more small nuclides with the emission of another neutron/s. Such neutrons may cause increasing nuclear fission reactions, called the chain reaction. A nuclear reactor is a device that is used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This reaction is the process by which atomic nuclei release energy through interactions with other particles. The heat produced by the fission reactions is used to generate steam, which in turn drives a turbine and generates electricity.

The fuel rods are surrounded by coolant, which is used to transfer heat from the core to a steam generator. The steam generator is used to produce steam, which drives the turbine to generate electricity. In addition to the fuel rods, the core of a nuclear reactor also contains control rods, which are used to regulate the rate of fission reactions by absorbing excess neutrons. The control rods can be moved up and down within the core to control the reaction rate.</div>
