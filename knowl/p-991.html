<div class="para">All the planets in our solar system are visible from Earth at various times, depending on their positions relative to the Sun and Earth. The five planets that are visible to the naked eye from Earth are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Mercury and Venus are called "inferior planets" because they orbit the Sun closer than Earth does, so they never appear very far from the Sun in the sky. Mercury is visible low on the horizon just after sunset or just before sunrise, and Venus is usually the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are called "superior planets" because they orbit the Sun farther than Earth does, so they can appear anywhere in the sky. Mars is typically reddish in color and is visible in the evening sky, while Jupiter and Saturn are both visible in the late evening and early morning skies and are usually among the brightest objects in the sky, after the Moon and Venus. Uranus and Neptune, the two outermost planets, are also visible from Earth, but they are much fainter and require binoculars or a telescope to see.</div>
