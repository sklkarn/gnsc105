<div class="para">However, there are other two types of solids also exist such as <dfn class="terminology">Polycrystalline Solids:</dfn> These are materials made up of many small crystalline regions or grains that are oriented in different directions. Polycrystalline solids often have improved mechanical properties over single crystals, as the different grain boundaries can strengthen the material. <dfn class="terminology">Composite Solids:</dfn>  These are materials made up of a combination of two or more different types of solids. The different components can have distinct properties, resulting in a material with a unique set of properties. Examples of composite solids include concrete, which is made up of cement and aggregate, and reinforced plastics, which are made up of a plastic matrix with embedded fibers for added strength.</div>
