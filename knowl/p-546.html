<div class="para">The nucleus  is the central and most important part of an atom. It is composed of protons and neutrons collectively known as known as <dfn class="terminology">nucleons</dfn>, and is located in the center of the atom. The protons in the nucleus are positively charged and the neutrons are neutral in charge. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number and the atomic element of the atom. The nucleons are held together by the strong nuclear force. Strong nuclear force is a very short-range attractive force that acts between nucleons and helps keep the nucleus from flying apart due to the repulsive force of the positively charged protons. The number of neutrons in a nucleus can vary for the same element, leading to the existence of <em class="emphasis">isotopes</em> . <dfn class="terminology">Isotopes</dfn> are atomic species of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. This means that isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but a different atomic mass. Due to the difference in the number of neutrons, isotopes of an element can have different physical and chemical properties. Some isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, while others are radioactive and decay over time. Isotopes are important in many fields, including medicine, industry, and scientific research. For example, in medicine, certain radioactive isotopes are used to diagnose and treat diseases, while in industry, stable isotopes are used as tracers to study the behavior of materials. In scientific research, isotopes are used to study the age of rocks and fossils, and to determine the origin and evolution of the universe. Here is the isotopic natation of the nucleus.</div>
