<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Nucleus</dfn> is a central part of an atom that contains positively charged particles called protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are collectively called nucleons. The number of protons in an atom is caled an atomic number. Atomic number determines the element to which the atom belongs. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons which are orbiting in shells. The atomic number and electronic arrangement in the shells determine the properties of an element. The size of nucleus is very small compared to the size of the atom, but it contains most mass of the atom. Therefore it is a highly dense part of the atom. The strong nuclear force holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. Nucleus undergoes many changes such as when two nuclei combine together to form a large nucleus, it is called a fusion process. But when a large nucleus splits into two or more nuclei it is called a fission process. The study of atomic nuclei is called nuclear physics. Atoms of the same element are different called isotopes of the element. The  <dfn class="terminology">isotopes</dfn> of an element are atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons in their nucleus.</div>
