<div class="para">Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the two ends of the conductor, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. It can be mathematically expressed as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
I = V/R 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">or,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
V=IR\tag{5.2.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">here I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance of the conductor. <em class="alert">Resistance:</em> is a restriction imposed by a conductor on the motion of a current. Motion of charge carriers (electrons) are not very smooth in a conductor as they bump onto the other electrons and positive charge residual atoms during their motion. Such restrictions in flow of electrons is measured as a resistance of a conductor in current flow. It is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and its unit is Ohms (<span class="process-math">\(\Omega\)</span>). <em class="alert">Electrical Power:</em> It is the measure of energy transferred or consumed per unit time i.e.,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
P \amp = \frac{Energy}{time}\\
or, \quad P \amp = \frac{qV}{t}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\therefore \quad P = IV\tag{5.2.2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Hence power is also defined as the product of current and voltage. Its unit is Watts (W). One watt means consuming the one joule of energy every second.</div>
