<div class="para">In uniform circular motion  object is moving at a constant speed (not velocity) on a circular path. For an object to be in uniform circular motion, there must be a net force acting on it. This force is called a <em class="alert">centripetal force</em> without this force nothing can move in a circular path. This net force is not a physical force of some kind rather some other forces must be there to act like a centripetel force. If the centripetal force , becomes zero suddenly, then the object flies off along a tangent to the circle. The centripetal force,</div>

<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is mass of the object, <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is speed of the object, and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is radius of the circluar path. Because of necessary centripetal force, sometime we feel difficulty to steer our car around a sharp curve. The sharper the curve (i.e., the smaller the radius) the greater the centripetal force required to keep the car on the curved path. Cetripetal means to look towards the center, hence centripetal force is always acting towards the center of the path.</div>
