<div class="para">The phases of the moon [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-moonphase.html" title="Figure 12.2.1.(b)">Figure 12.2.1.(b)</a>] refer to the appearance of the illuminated portion of the moon as seen from Earth as it orbits around our planet. The moon goes through a cycle of eight distinct phases:</div>

<div class="para">The rotation period of the Moon is approximately 27.3 days to complete one rotation on its axis. This time is also known as sidereal month. A <dfn class="terminology">sidereal month</dfn> is the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth as measured against the fixed background of stars. This is slightly shorter than the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same phase (such as full moon to full moon) as observed from Earth, which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">synodic month</dfn>. This is the same amount of time that the Moon takes to orbit around the Earth as seen from the moon. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, a phenomenon known as "tidal locking." While the moon orbits a complete circle around the earth, the earth itself rotates around the sun. As a result, it seems to us that moon is taking about 29.53 days to orbit around the earth. This 29.53 days is called lunar month. A lunar month is the time it takes for the Moon to complete one cycle of phases, from New Moon to New Moon. It’s worth noting that this period of 29.53 days is different from the Moon’s orbital period around the Earth, which is approximately 27.3 days. The difference between these two periods is due to the fact that the Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, so the Moon has to travel slightly farther to complete a full cycle of phases as seen from Earth <a class="external" href="https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/lunar-phase-simulator/" target="_blank">Moon phase animation</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-65-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.</div>
