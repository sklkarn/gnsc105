<div class="para">Venus [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-venus.html" title="Figure 12.1.3">Figure 12.1.3</a>] is the second planet from the Sun and is sometimes called Earth’s sister planet due to its similar size and composition. However, Venus has a very different climate and geology than Earth. Venus has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that completely obscure its surface. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is about 90 times greater than Earth’s, making it a very hostile environment for exploration. Despite the challenges of studying its surface, scientists have been able to use radar and other methods to create maps and images of Venus. These have revealed that Venus has a diverse landscape, with highland regions, flat plains, and thousands of volcanic structures. One of the most striking features on Venus is the massive shield volcano known as Maat Mons, which is one of the highest mountains in the solar system. Venus also has a number of other large volcanic structures, including the volcano Ozza Mons and the pancake-shaped volcano Theia Mons. Another notable feature on Venus is its extensive system of canyons and valleys, which are similar in appearance to those found on Mars. These features provide evidence of past tectonic activity and suggest that Venus may have experienced significant geological changes over time.</div>
