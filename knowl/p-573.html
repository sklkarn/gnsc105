<div class="para">Nuclear reactions are the process in which nucleus of an atom changes. These changes can be either decay processes, in which the nucleus of an atom emits particles or radiation, or fusion processes, in which two or more atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier nucleus. There are two main types of nuclear reactions:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Nuclear Fission Reactions: These reactions involve the spontaneous decay of an unstable nucleus into a more stable form. Common types of nuclear decay reactions include alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Nuclear Fusion Reactions: These reactions involve the fusion of two atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, and is the reaction that powers the sun. Nuclear fusion reactions are difficult to achieve on Earth, but are being researched as a potential source of clean and abundant energy.</div></li>
