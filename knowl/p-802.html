<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">water table</dfn> is the level below the ground surface where the soil or rock is saturated with water. It represents the upper boundary of the zone of saturation, which is the area beneath the ground surface where all of the pore spaces in the soil or rock are filled with water. The water table can be at different depths depending on the local geology, climate, and land use practices. The water table can rise or fall depending on the amount of precipitation, evaporation, and human water use in the area. When there is excess rainfall or snowmelt, the water table can rise, which can cause shallow wells and basements to flood. Conversely, during periods of drought or increased human water use, the water table can fall, which can cause wells to go dry and lead to decreased streamflow and other environmental impacts. The depth of the water table is an important factor in determining the availability of groundwater for drinking water, agriculture, and other uses. It is typically measured using a monitoring well that is drilled into the ground and equipped with a device that can measure the water level in the well. Groundwater management practices often focus on maintaining the water table at a sustainable level to ensure continued availability of this important resource.</div>
