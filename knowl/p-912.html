<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">mid-ocean ridge</dfn> is an underwater mountain range that runs along the floor of the Earth’s ocean basins. When two tectonic plates are moving away from each other at divergent plate boundary magma from the mantle rises up and solidify and forms a new oceanic crust. The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth which expands over 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) and covers more than 23% of the Earth’s surface. It forms volcanic islands and is located in all of the Earth’s major oceans. A <dfn class="terminology">volcanic eruption</dfn> is a geological event that occurs when magma, ash, and gases escape from a volcano. Volcanic eruptions can be explosive or effusive and can vary in intensity and duration. Explosive eruptions occur when a buildup of pressure causes a sudden release of gas, ash, and magma. These eruptions can be violent and destructive. Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, are a steady flow of lava from the volcano. These eruptions can last for weeks, months, or even years, and can create new land by adding layers of solidified lava to the landscape.</div>
