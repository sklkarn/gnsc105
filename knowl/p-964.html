<div class="para">The Magellanic Clouds are two small satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way galaxy. The Magellanic Clouds are located in the southern hemisphere, and they are visible to the naked eye from the southern latitudes. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the larger of the two clouds, and it is located about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. It has a diameter of about 14,000 light-years and contains tens of billions of stars, as well as <dfn class="terminology">star-forming regions</dfn>, supernova remnants, and other astronomical objects. The Magellanic Clouds are important objects for astronomers to study because they provide insight into the evolution of satellite galaxies and their interactions with larger host galaxies like the Milky Way. They are also used as calibration objects for measuring the distances to more distant galaxies, which helps astronomers to understand the large-scale structure of the universe.</div>
