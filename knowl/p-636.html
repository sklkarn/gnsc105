<div class="para">Free radicals  are atoms, molecules or ions that have an unpaired electron in their outermost shell. They are highly reactive and unstable because they seek to pair their unpaired electron with another electron, either from another molecule or from another part of the same molecule. This process can cause damage to cells and tissues, and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and aging. Free radicals can be generated through normal metabolic processes in the body, as well as through exposure to environmental factors such as radiation, pollution, cigarette smoke, and certain chemicals. Some of the most common free radicals in the body include superoxide, hydroxyl, and nitric oxide radicals. To neutralize free radicals, the body relies on antioxidants, which are molecules that can donate an electron to the free radical without becoming unstable themselves. Antioxidants can be obtained from a variety of sources, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and selenium are all examples of antioxidants that can help neutralize free radicals in the body.</div>
