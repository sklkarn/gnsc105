<div class="para">If an object is changing its position with time then the object is said to be in motion. It is a relative quantity. For example, suppose Aron and Bob are sitting in car then they are at rest relative to each other even if the car is running on the road or just at rest in the parking palce. However, if Charley is observing Aron and Bob from outside of car and car is moving then both of them are in motion for Charley and same applies to to Aron and Bob for Charley. Meaning Aron and Bob can tell Charley is in motion going behind them but they are at rest. It is our human instict that Aron and Bob understand that they are going in the car so they are in motion with with respect to the road and Charley is at rest. Here we are going to learn motion of objects with respect to the earth.</div>
