<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">lunar landscape</dfn> is characterized by a vast expanse of barren, rocky terrain. The Moon’s surface is covered in a layer of loose, powdery soil called regolith, which is composed of small rock fragments and dust that have been ground down by the impact of meteoroids over millions of years. The lunar landscape is marked by numerous impact <dfn class="terminology">craters</dfn>, which range in size from small bowl-shaped depressions to vast circular basins hundreds of kilometers across. These craters were formed by the impact of meteoroids and other objects over billions of years, and their shapes and sizes provide important clues about the history and evolution of the Moon. In addition to craters, the lunar landscape also features several other prominent surface features. These include <dfn class="terminology">mountains</dfn>, such as the towering peaks of the Montes Apenninus and the Taurus-Littrow Valley, as well as vast plains, such as the dark and flat lava plains known as mare (singular: "maria"). The Moon’s lack of atmosphere and weather means that its landscape has remained largely unchanged for billions of years, making it a valuable natural laboratory for studying the geology and evolution of planetary bodies. The Moon’s unique features and scientific potential have also made it a target for future exploration and potential resource utilization.</div>
