<div class="para">Earth <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-earth.html" title="Figure 12.1.4">Figure 12.1.4</a>is the third planet from the sun and is the only known planet in the universe that supports life. It has a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and a mass of approximately <span class="process-math">\(5.97 \times 10^24 \)</span>kilograms. The Earth revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit, completing one orbit every 365.24 days. It also rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night cycles. The tilt of its axis is responsible for the changing seasons. It has a unique atmosphere that is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is covered by approximately 71% water, which is contained in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the remaining 29% is composed of landmasses, such as continents and islands. The Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field, which protects it from harmful solar winds and radiation. The planet also has a natural satellite, the moon, which orbits around it. The Earth is a dynamic and constantly changing planet, with a complex system of tectonic plates that cause earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building. It is also home to a diverse range of life forms, including humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This tilt is responsible for the changing seasons and the different amounts of daylight and darkness throughout the year. <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ncfAsmiSg" target="_blank">Layers of Earth</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-57-hidden.html" title="Footnote 11.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
