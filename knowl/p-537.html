<dfn class="terminology">Atomic mass unit</dfn> (amu) is a unit of mass used to express the relative masses of atoms and molecules. It is defined as one twelfth (1/12) of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, which is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. This means that the mass of one proton or one neutron is approximately 1 amu, and the mass of an electron is much smaller, about 0.0005 amu. The atomic mass of an element, which is the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes, is expressed in amu. The use of atomic mass units is convenient because it allows us to compare the masses of different atoms and molecules on a relative scale. For example, the mass of a hydrogen atom is about 1 amu, while the mass of an oxygen atom is about 16 amu.</div>
