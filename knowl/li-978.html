<dfn class="terminology">Metamorphic rocks</dfn> are formed from the transformation of existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks) due to heat, pressure, or chemical activity, without melting. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, slate, and gneiss. Metamorphic rocks can form deep beneath the Earth’s surface, where they are subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures, or closer to the surface, where they are exposed to hot fluids or intense deformation. Metamorphic rocks can be classified into two main types: <dfn class="terminology">foliated and non-foliated</dfn>. Foliated metamorphic rocks, such as slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss, have a layered or banded appearance due to the alignment of mineral grains under pressure. Non-foliated metamorphic rocks, such as marble and quartzite, do not have a layered or banded appearance and are typically composed of a single mineral or mineral type. The texture and composition of metamorphic rocks can also provide information about the tectonic environment and geologic history of the region in which they formed. Metamorphic rocks provide valuable information about the Earth’s history and geologic processes. For example, they can provide evidence of past mountain-building events and the movement of tectonic plates. Metamorphic rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals, such as gold, silver, and copper.  List of some common rocks are given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rocks2.html" title="Figure 11.2.4">Figure 11.2.4</a>.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-978" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
