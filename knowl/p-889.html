<div class="para">The speed of plate movement can vary from a few millimet4Xebwzb3dDEers to several centimeters per year. A <dfn class="terminology">mid-ocean ridge</dfn> is an underwater mountain range that runs along the floor of the Earth's ocean basins. It is a divergent plate boundary where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other, causing magma from the Earth's mantle to rise up and solidify, forming new oceanic crust. The mid-ocean ridge system is the longest mountain range on Earth, stretching over 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) and covering more than 23% of the Earth's surface. It is located in all of the Earth's major oceans, and its highest points are often found above sea level, forming volcanic islands. A <dfn class="terminology">volcanic eruption</dfn> is a geological event that occurs when magma, ash, and gases escape from a volcano. Volcanic eruptions can be explosive or effusive and can vary in intensity and duration. Explosive eruptions occur when a buildup of pressure causes a sudden release of gas, ash, and magma. These eruptions can be violent and destructive, sending plumes of ash and debris high into the air and causing widespread damage to surrounding areas. Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, are characterized by a steady flow of lava from the volcano. These eruptions can last for weeks, months, or even years, and can create new land by adding layers of solidified lava to the landscape.</div>
