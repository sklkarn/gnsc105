<div class="para">Anything that occupies space and has some mass is called matter. Everything around us is made up of matter. Matter can exist in three different forms depending on the conditions. These different forms of matter are also called the phases (or states) of matter. They are solid, liquid, or gas. On earth, water can exist in all three states at natural temperature. Ice is the solid form of water, water itself is in liquis form, and vapor is the gaseous state of water. <em class="alert">Solid:</em> has definite shape and size (volume). Particles in a solid have strong bonds between each other. The particles in a solid can vibrate but the structure doesn't not change. metals and wood are some exaples of solid. <em class="alert">Liquid:</em> has a definite size (volume) but does not have definite shape. Liquid takes the shape of the container where it is in. Particles (molecules) in a liquid are more spread out and can move around and bump into each other. Water and oil are some examples of liquid. <em class="alert">Gas:</em> neither has a definite size (volume) nor has a definite shape. Gas also takes the shape of the container where it is in and you can compress more gas in the same container. Particles (molecules) in a gas are far apart and can move around freely and quickly. Steam and air are some examples of gas.</div>
