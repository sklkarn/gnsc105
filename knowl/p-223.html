<em class="alert">Heat:</em> we feel hot when we stand outside in a scorching summer day and we feel cold on touching an iron bar in the morning of a severing winter day. Such a sensation of hotness and coldness is called heat. Heat is a form of energy that can transfer from one location to another because of the temperature difference. A quantitative measure of the sensation of hotness or coldness is given by temperature. Therefore, <em class="alert">temperature</em> is the relative measure of hotness or coldness of a body. Heat energy is produced at the expense of mechanical energy and vice a versa. For example, rubbing palms vigorously makes palm warmer. Work and heat both transfer the energy from one system to another but temperature plays no role in transfer of energy due to work. Objects can store heat (or thermal energy) because the atoms and molecules of the objects are jostling around and bumping onto one another. This type of thermal energy is called an <em class="emphasis">internal kinetic energy</em> of the materials. The energy also arise in molecules due to intermolecular attractions. This type of energy is called an <em class="emphasis">internal potential energy.</em> During phase change of a material heat is stored in the form of internal potential energy. For example, heating of ice melts it without any rise of temperature. This energy is used in driving the molecules of ice away from each other against their molecular attraction. While internal energy refers to the total energy of all the molecules within the object, heat is the amount of energy flowing from one body to another spontaneously due to their temperature difference. Heat is energy in transit but not a property of the system. To measure how hot or cold something is, we use an instrument called a thermometer. Hence, the <em class="alert">thermometer</em> is a device used to measure temperature. The definition of temperature is not very straight forward to explain but the degree of hotness or coldness of a body would suffice the definition for now. In molecular level, <em class="emphasis">temperature</em> is the average kinetic of the molecules of a substance, where as <em class="emphasis">heat</em> is energy in transit because of temperature difference. Hence, there is no notion of heat in a body. When heat is added to a body, internal energy of the molecules of the body increases and when heat is lost by the body its internal energy decreases. Since heat is a form of energy its SI unit is Joule (J), but the common unit of heat is <em class="emphasis">calorie (cal)</em>. A  calorie is defined as the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one gram of water to one degree Celsius at normal temperature and pressure (NTP).</div>
