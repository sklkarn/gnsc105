<div class="para">On the other hand, an <dfn class="terminology">exothermic reaction</dfn>  is a chemical reaction that releases heat energy into its surroundings. In other words, it gives off energy during the reaction. During an exothermic reaction, the temperature of the system increases as the reaction proceeds because heat is being released from the reaction. Examples of exothermic reactions include burning of wood, combustion reactions, and neutralization reactions. The burning of coal (carbon)</div>

<div class="para">The dissolution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water is an exothermic process, which means that it releases heat. When NaOH dissolves in water, it undergoes a chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of heat. This energy is then transferred to the surrounding environment, causing the temperature of the solution to increase.</div>
