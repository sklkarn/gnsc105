<div class="para">Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is ”greater than 5”, round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is ”less than 5”, leave the 2 alone and don’t round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don’t round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).</div></li>
</ol>

<li>
<div class="para">Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to ”place” the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.</div></li>
</ol>

<li>
<div class="para">Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is ”odd” and followed by a ”5”, then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is ”even” and followed by a ”5”, then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.</div></li>
