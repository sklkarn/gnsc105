<dfn class="terminology">Oceanic-oceanic plate collision:</dfn> When two oceanic plates collide, one plate usually subducts beneath the other, creating a subduction zone. The subducted plate is forced down into the mantle, creating a deep <dfn class="terminology">trench</dfn>, while the overriding plate forms an island arc, a curved chain of volcanic islands. As the subducted plate sinks deeper into the mantle, it heats up and begins to melt. This process can also lead to volcanic activity. This volcanic activity can contribute to the growth of the island arc. Over time, the volcanic activity can also lead to the formation of a new oceanic crust, as magma solidifies and builds up on the seafloor. One example of an oceanic-oceanic plate collision is the collision between the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which has created the Marianas Trench and the Mariana Islands, a volcanic island arc in the western Pacific Ocean.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-platetect.html#li-1008" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
