<dfn class="terminology">Kelvin Scale:</dfn> The scale of thermometers depends upon the physical property (thermal expansion, electrical resistance, etc.) of the substance that is used in the thermometer. The physical property (e.g. thermal expansion) of materials varies differently at the different range of temperatures hence all these thermometers have a limited use. With the idea of constructing a temperature scale which should be independent on the material properties, Scottish physicist William Thomson, Baron Kelvin proposed on the basis of thermodynamics principles that the lowest possible temperature that could be achieved was <span class="process-math">\(-273 ^oC\text{,}\)</span> in 1848. This minimum temperature is the zero point on Kelvin scale and is known as absolute zero. Kelvin scale is a hypothetical (theoretical) thermometer scale and is also known as absolute scale. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.</div>
