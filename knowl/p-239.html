<dfn class="terminology">Convection:</dfn> In this process heat transfer occurs by the actual movement of fluid particles. Convection is heat transport due to bulk fluid motion. Convection happens in gases and liquids. When a fluid is heated, its molecules which are in contact with the hot surface get hot and expand. That is the fluid above a hot surface expands, becomes less dense, and rises. It carries the thermal energy along when rises up. The relatively cold fluid on the upper surface is heavier and sink down near the heat source. Hence a current of heat cycle develops in the convection process, called convection cycle.</div>
