<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">atom</dfn> is the basic unit of matter and the defining structure of elements. The term "atom" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. However, we now know that atoms are made up of smaller particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element the atom is. Atoms form molecules through chemical bonds and make up all matter in the universe. They play a crucial role in many processes, such as chemical reactions, combustion, and the transmission of signals in living organisms. Understanding the properties of atoms and how they interact with each other is essential for fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. The study of atoms is called atomic physics. It wasn't until the 19th century that the idea of atoms gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron and showed that atoms were made up of negatively charged particles. Then, in 1909, Ernest Rutherford demonstrated that atoms also contained a positive nucleus. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model for the atomic structure that explained the periodic table of elements and the spectra of light emitted by atoms. Throughout the 20th century, scientists continued to study atoms and their components, leading to the development of quantum mechanics and a deeper understanding of atomic structure and behavior. This research has numerous applications in fields such as energy production, electronics, and medicine.</div>
