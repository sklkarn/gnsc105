<div class="para">The blackbody radiation plot shows the spectral distribution of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody as a function of wavelength or frequency. The plot is typically represented as a curve that shows the intensity of the radiation emitted at each wavelength or frequency. The shape of the blackbody radiation curve depends on the temperature of the blackbody. At low temperatures, the curve peaks at longer wavelengths in the infrared region. As the temperature increases, the peak of the curve moves towards shorter wavelengths, and at high temperatures, the peak is in the ultraviolet region. The blackbody radiation plot is an important tool for understanding the nature of heat and light. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bbr.html" title="Figure 7.1.2">FigureÂ 7.1.2</a> shows how the brightness of the light varies with wavelength emitted by the objects at four different temperatures. It has been observed that all objects radiate electromagnetic radiation and the strongest wavelength depends on its temperature. The higher the temperature of the body, the shorter the brightest wavelength (or, the higher the frequency). For example, a hot iron bar that glows yellow is hotter than one that glows red. For an object at room temperature, most of the radiation emits in infrared region and hence is invisible.</div>
