<div class="para">In <dfn class="terminology">radioactive decay</dfn> process different kinds of elements form due to emission of different particles or rays such as</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Alpha (<span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span>) particle emission: <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> particle is a helium nucleus and is positively charged particle. In  <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> decay a nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This results in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by two and transforms the nucleus into a different element. Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus has too many protons and is not stable, and it releases energy in the form of the alpha particle to reach a more stable configuration. Alpha particles have a large mass and a low velocity, and they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-raddecay.html" title="Figure 7.2.2">Figure 7.2.2</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Beta (<span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span>) particle emission: <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> particle is similar to electron and hence holds negative charge. In <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> decay a nucleus emits a high-energy electron or positron, also known as a beta particle. This results in a change in the number of protons in the nucleus and transforms the nucleus into a different element. There are two types of beta decay: beta minus decay (emission of an electron) and beta plus decay (emission of a positron). In beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. In beta plus decay, a proton decays into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino. Beta decay is one of the three common types of radioactive decay, along with alpha decay and gamma decay. Beta particles have a low mass and a high velocity, and they can penetrate sheets of paper and even thin sheet of aluminum foil <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-raddecay.html" title="Figure 7.2.2">Figure 7.2.2</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Gamma (<span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span>) rays emission: <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> ray is an electromagnetic radiation of very high energy and is neutral to the charge. If the nucleus is unstable due to access amount of energy then it releases <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> rays. The composition of nucleus does not change due to gamma radiation emissioin. Gamma rays have no rest mass and travel with the velocity of light and hence penetrate even thick plate of lead <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-raddecay.html" title="Figure 7.2.2">Figure 7.2.2</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Electron (<span class="process-math">\(e^{-1}\)</span>) Capture: it is another type of radioactive decay in which an inner orbital electron is captured by the nucleus and transforms into a neutron, resulting in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by one and the transformation of the nucleus into a different element. The captured electron combines with a proton to form a neutron, which remains inside the nucleus. This process releases energy in the form of gamma rays or X-rays. Electron capture is different from beta decay, which involves the emission of a beta particle (an electron or a positron).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Positron <span class="process-math">\(e^{+1}\)</span> Emission: it is also known as beta plus decay, is a type of radioactive decay in which a nucleus emits a positron, which is the antiparticle of an electron. Positron emission occurs when a nucleus has too many protons and is not stable, and it releases energy in the form of the positron to reach a more stable configuration. The emitted positron quickly combines with an electron in the material, annihilating both particles and producing gamma rays. Positron emission is one of the three common types of radioactive decay, along with alpha decay and beta decay. In positron emission, a proton inside the nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino. This results in a decrease in the atomic number of the nucleus by one and the transformation of the nucleus into a different element.</div></li>
