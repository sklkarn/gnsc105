<div class="para">In fission reactions, the mass defect of the original nucleus is converted into energy, which is released as kinetic energy of the fission products and as gamma radiation. This energy can be harnessed for practical purposes, such as generating electricity in nuclear power plants, or for destructive purposes, such as in atomic bombs. Binding energy in a fusion reaction refers to the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces between positively charged nuclei and bring them close enough together to form a heavier nucleus through a fusion process. When the nuclei are close enough, they can form a single nucleus through the strong force, releasing a large amount of energy in the process.</div>
