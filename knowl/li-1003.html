<dfn class="terminology">Pyrite:</dfn> Pyrite, also known as "foolâ€™s gold," is a common mineral that is found in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks around the world. It is composed of iron sulfide <span class="process-math">\((FeS_2)\)</span> and has a metallic luster, giving it a shiny, brassy-yellow appearance. Pyrite is relatively hard and can scratch glass. It is often found in association with other minerals, such as quartz, calcite, and fluorite. Pyrite has been used as a source of sulfur for the production of sulfuric acid, and it is also used as a decorative stone and in jewelry. One of the most notable properties of pyrite is its ability to generate sparks when struck against steel or another hard surface. This property has made pyrite a popular material for use in flintlock firearms and other types of fire-starting tools.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-1003" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
