<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">atmosphere</dfn> is the layer of gases [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atmlayer1.html" title="Figure 10.0.1.(a)">Figure 10.0.1.(a)</a>] that surrounds our planet. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of four main layers. The lowermost layer is the <em class="alert">troposphere</em>, which extends from the Earth’s surface to an altitude of about 8-15 kilometers. This is where all weather (such as clouds, rain) occurs, and it contains most of the Earth’s breathable air [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atmlayer1.html" title="Figure 10.0.1.(a)">Figure 10.0.1.(a)</a>]. Above the troposphere is the <em class="alert">stratosphere</em>, which extends from about 15-50 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains the ozone layer, which helps protect the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Long distance flights (airoplanes and jets) fly in the lower level of this layer. Beyond the stratosphere is the <em class="alert">mesosphere</em>, which extends from about 50-85 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. This layer is where <em class="emphasis">meteors</em> burn up as they enter the Earth’s atmosphere. The outermost layer of the Earth’s atmosphere is the <em class="alert">thermosphere</em>, which extends from about 85 kilometers to the edge of space. This layer is characterized by very low air density but very high temperatures, and it is where the auroras occur and the space shuttle orbits. Atmosphere regulate the water cycle and whether conditioning on the earth. Thermosphere is also known as <em class="emphasis">ionosphere</em> as the solar radiation ionizes the upper atmosphere into ions and electrons. During sun storms ions of nitrogen and oxygen in the thermosphere produce beutiful aurora borialis in presence of earth magnetic field. Ionosphere makes long distance radio communication possible. Above the ionospher we have large regions of space with very thin gases we called the exosphere. But we do not include this layer in our discussion here.</div>
