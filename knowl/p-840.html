<div class="para">Like the Moon, Venus exhibits phases as seen from Earth. The phases of Venus occur because Venus orbits the Sun, and as it does so, its position relative to the Earth changes, causing us to see different amounts of its illuminated surface. When Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, it is in its "full" phase, with its entire illuminated surface facing away from us. As Venus moves closer to Earth in its orbit, it begins to appear as a "waning gibbous" phase, where it is more than half illuminated but not yet fully illuminated. When Venus reaches its closest point to Earth in its orbit, it appears in its "half" or "first quarter" phase, with half of its illuminated surface facing us. As Venus moves further along in its orbit, it appears as a "waxing crescent" phase, with less than half of its illuminated surface visible. Finally, as Venus approaches its position on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, it appears as a "new" phase, with its fully illuminated surface facing away from us. Venus then moves back around the other side of the Sun and begins the cycle of phases again. The phases of Venus are one of the key pieces of evidence that supported the heliocentric model of the solar system, where the planets orbit the Sun, rather than the geocentric model, where the Earth was thought to be the center of the universe. The phases of Venus were first observed by Galileo in 1610, and their regular pattern was later explained by the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus.</div>
