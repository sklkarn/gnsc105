<div class="para">The greenhouse effect  is a natural process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap and re-emit heat radiated from the Earth's surface, leading to a warming effect on the planet's surface temperature. These gases, including carbon dioxide <span class="process-math">\((CO_2)\text{,}\)</span> methane <span class="process-math">\((CH_4)\text{,}\)</span> water vapor <span class="process-math">\((H_2O)\text{,}\)</span> and nitrous oxide <span class="process-math">\((N2O)\text{,}\)</span> are known as greenhouse gases. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be around <span class="process-math">\(-18°C (0°F)\text{,}\)</span> which would be too cold to support life as we know it. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and <dfn class="terminology">global warming</dfn> . The consequences of global warming can include sea level rise, more frequent and severe weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, and impacts on <em class="emphasis">ecosystems</em> and human health. Therefore, it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</div>
