<div class="para"> Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight depending on the angle of the Sun's rays <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-earthseason.html" title="Figure 10.2.1">Figure 10.2.1</a>. During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun, and the Sun's rays hit the Northern Hemisphere at a more direct angle, providing more heat and longer daylight hours. At the same time, the South Pole is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in shorter days and cooler temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere. During the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun, and the Sun's rays hit the Northern Hemisphere at a more indirect angle, providing less heat and shorter daylight hours. At the same time, the South Pole is tilted toward the Sun, resulting in longer days and warmer temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere. These changes in the angle of the Sun's rays as Earth orbits around the Sun cause the <dfn class="terminology">seasons</dfn> to occur <a class="external" href="https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/eclipticsimulator.html" target="_blank">season animation</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 10.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. The distance between the Earth and the Sun does have an effect on the amount of solar radiation that the Earth receives, but it is not the main factor that determines the seasons. The primary factor that determines the seasons on Earth is the tilt of its axis.</div>
