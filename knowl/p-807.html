<dfn class="terminology">Anticyclones</dfn> are areas of high pressure that are typically associated with clear skies, calm winds, and dry weather. In an anticyclone, air is sinking rather than rising. As the air sinks, it warms and dries out, which leads to clear skies and dry weather. Because of this, anticyclones are often associated with calm weather conditions, such as clear skies, light winds, and dry air. Anticyclones can provide periods of stable, dry weather that is ideal for outdoor activities. However, prolonged periods of high pressure can lead to drought conditions and poor air quality due to stagnant air. In the Northern Hemisphere, anticyclones rotate clockwise and in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate counterclockwise. Anticyclones are often referred to as high-pressure systems and are associated with stable weather conditions. Cyclones can cause strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge, while anticyclones can cause calm winds, clear skies, and temperature inversions.</div>
