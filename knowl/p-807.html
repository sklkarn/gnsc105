<dfn class="terminology">Tornado</dfn>  is a violent cyclonic storm. Tornadoes are capable of producing extreme winds, often in excess of 200 miles per hour, and can cause significant damage and loss of life. The warm, moist air near the ground rises rapidly, and the cooler, drier air aloft descends, creating a rotating updraft within the thunderstorm. This updraft can become concentrated and elongated, creating a visible funnel-shaped cloud. When the funnel cloud makes contact with the ground, it becomes a tornado. Tornadoes are typically short-lived, lasting only a few minutes, but can cause significant damage in that time. They can uproot trees, destroy buildings, and toss vehicles hundreds of yards away. Tornadoes can occur anywhere in the world, but the United States experiences more tornadoes than any other country, particularly in the central and southern regions known as Tornado Alley.</div>
