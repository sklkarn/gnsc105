<dfn class="terminology">Amorphous Solids:</dfn> These are solids without a regular lattice structure. In <em class="emphasis">Greek</em> amorphous means "without form". The arrangement of particles in amorphous solids is random and disordered. Examples include glass, rubber, and plastic. <em class="emphasis">Glass</em> is amorphous because its atoms or molecules do not have a regular or periodic arrangement. Unlike crystalline solids, which have a well-defined lattice structure, the arrangement of particles in glass is random and disordered. The amorphous nature of glass arises due to the way it is formed. Glass is typically made by cooling a molten liquid too quickly for its atoms or molecules to arrange themselves into a regular lattice structure. As a result, the particles in glass are frozen in a random arrangement, leading to an amorphous solid. This amorphous nature of glass gives it some unique properties, such as being transparent, brittle, and having a relatively low melting point compared to crystalline solids. The lack of a defined structure also means that glass can be easily molded into a variety of shapes, making it useful in many applications such as windows, lenses, and optical fibers. However, the lack of a defined structure also makes glass more prone to fractures and cracking, as the random arrangement of particles makes it difficult for the material to dissipate stress and strain. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-amorps.html" title="Figure 9.0.1.(b)">FigureÂ 9.0.1.(b)</a></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ch_ninth.html#li-773" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
