<div class="para">Different materials behave differently to heat. Most materials increase their volume when heated, but there are some exceptional materials which shrink their volume on heating. For example: glass, steel, concrete, brass, etc. expand on heating or in rise of temperature. But welding iron, invar, etc. shrink volume on heating. Water on the other hand can shrink its volume when heated from <span class="process-math">\(0 ^oC\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(4 ^oC\)</span> and expands after heating beyond that temperature. Such properties of water is called an anomalous behavior of water. Due to this property of water aquatic animals survive when a pond is frozen in the winter.</div>
