<div class="para">As we know now that the most materials change their volume on heating. Such property of materials can be used to design thermometers to measure the temperature. There are varieties of thermometers in existence based on the phase (state) of materials is being used in thermometer.  They are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. For example: If solid substance is used in thermometers, then the thermometers are called solid state thermometers. Platinum resistance thermometer, thermometer strip on the wall of aquarium, etc. are solid state thermometers. If liquid is used in a thermometer, then it is called a liquid thermometer. Mercury thermometer, alcohol thermometer, etc. are some examples. If gas is used then thermometer is called a gas thermometer. Hydrogen gas thermometer, hilium gas thermometer, nitrogen gas thermometer, etc. are some some examples.</div>
