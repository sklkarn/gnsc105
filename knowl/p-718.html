<div class="para">Rocks and minerals are naturally occurring substances found in the earth's crust. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals, while minerals are pure substances with a <em class="emphasis">definite chemical composition</em> and crystalline structure. A <dfn class="terminology">mineral</dfn> may be a single element such as copper (Cu) or gold (Au), or it may be a compound made up of a number of elements. About 2,500 different minerals have been described. <dfn class="terminology">Rocks</dfn> are made up of one or more minerals but it <em class="emphasis">does not have a definite chemical compositions</em>. Minerals are classified based on their chemical composition and crystal structure. Some <em class="alert">common minerals</em> include quartz, feldspar, mica, calcite, and pyrite. Minerals have a wide range of uses, from building materials to electronics and jewelry.</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Quartz:</dfn> is composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a continuous framework of <span class="process-math">\(SiO_4\)</span> silicon-oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen atom shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of <span class="process-math">\(SiO_2\text{.}\)</span> It is a six-sided prisms with pointed ends (known as hexagonal crystals) with no cleavage. The color of quartz can vary depending on impurities, with clear quartz being colorless, while other colors such as pink, purple, and brown can be caused by trace amounts of other elements.</div></li>

<dfn class="terminology">Feldspar:</dfn> is a group of minerals that are the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust comes with range of color, harder than glass and softer than quartz. The feldspar group is divided into two major groups: alkali feldspar and plagioclase feldspar. Alkali feldspar includes minerals such as orthoclase and microcline, while plagioclase feldspar includes minerals such as albite, anorthite, and labradorite.</div></li>
