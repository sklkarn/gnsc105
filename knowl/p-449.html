<div class="para">Binding energy is the amount of energy required to separate a nucleons into the protons and neutrons. In an atomic nucleus, the protons and neutrons are held together by the strong nuclear force, which acts over short distances. The binding energy of a nucleus can be calculated by subtracting the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons from the total mass of the nucleus itself. According to Einstein's famous equation,</div>

\begin{equation}
E=mc^2\text{,}\tag{7.2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">the mass difference between the two states is equivalent to the binding energy. The binding energy of a nucleus has important implications for both the stability of the nucleus and for the energy released during nuclear reactions. Nuclei with higher binding energy are generally more stable and less likely to undergo spontaneous decay, while nuclei with lower binding energy are more likely to undergo radioactive decay. Additionally, the energy released during nuclear reactions is directly proportional to the binding energy of the nucleus.</div>
