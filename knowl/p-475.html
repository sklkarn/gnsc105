<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Echo and reverberation are two distinct phenomenon of sound waves which occur due to its reflection from any surfaces. Sound endures in our brain for longer than 0.1 second. If sound is reflected from any surface reaches to our ear within 0.1 second of the initial sound, then it seems that the sound is prolonged. The reception of reflected sound within 0.1 second causes the reverberation(or) the prolonging of a sound effect. The speed of sound in air is about <span class="process-math">\(340\, m/s\)</span> at room temperature. If the wall of a room is <span class="process-math">\(17 \)</span> meter away from the source of sound then it reflects back from the wall and reaches to the ear within 0.1 s</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
t=\frac{d}{v} = \frac{2\times 17}{0340} = 0.1 \,s. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Hence, causing a prolonged sound effect, called a <em class="alert">reverberation</em>. <em class="alert">Echoes</em> are also the effect of reflection of sound waves perceived by the ear. When a reflected sound wave reaches the ear after 0.1 seconds of the original sound was heard, then echoes are produced. If the elapsed time between the arrivals of the two sound waves is more than 0.1 seconds, then the sensation of the first sound will have died out. In other words, echo is a sensation of second sound wave after the effect of original sound wave will vanish. It is not a prolonging of the original sound wave as in reverberation.</div>
