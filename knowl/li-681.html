<dfn class="terminology">Mica:</dfn> Mica is a group of minerals that is found in rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist. It is composed of silicate minerals with varying amounts of aluminum, potassium, magnesium, iron, and water. Mica is known for its unique properties, such as its ability to split into thin, flexible sheets, its excellent insulating properties, and its resistance to heat and chemicals. These properties make it a valuable material in a wide range of industries, including electronics, construction, cosmetics, and paint manufacturing.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-681" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
