<div class="para">Most post-transition metals are actually is non-metals. Non-metals are elements that do not have metallic properties and are typically poor conductors of heat and electricity. The non-metals are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table and are grouped together in several columns, or groups. The main groups of non-metals in the periodic table are:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Group 14 (Carbon Group): This group includes the non-metal carbon (C), which is the basis for all organic molecules, as well as the metalloids silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Group 15 (Nitrogen Group): This group includes the non-metal nitrogen (N), which is a key component of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, as well as the non-metals phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Group 16 (Chalcogens): This group includes the non-metals oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), polonium (Po), and livermorium (Lv). The chalcogens are known for their ability to form compounds with a wide range of other elements, and they are involved in many important biological and industrial processes. For example, oxygen is essential for respiration and combustion, while sulfur is used in the production of fertilizers and other chemicals. Selenium and tellurium are used in the manufacture of semiconductors, while polonium has important nuclear applications. They are non-metals, and they have relatively high electronegativities and melting points. They also tend to form compounds with other elements that are covalent or ionic in nature.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Group 17 (Halogens): This group includes the non-metals fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). The halogens are highly reactive and form a variety of compounds.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Group 18 (Noble Gases): This group includes the non-metals helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). The noble gases are generally unreactive and have very low boiling points.</div></li>
