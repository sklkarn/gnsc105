<dfn class="terminology">Covalent bond:</dfn>  In covalent bonding  atoms share electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This is the most common between non-metal atoms. Covalent bonding can take on a variety of forms including single, double, and triple bonds. For examples: in hydrogen molecule (<span class="process-math">\(H_2\)</span>), water molecule (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>), methan gas molecule (<span class="process-math">\(CH_4\)</span>), diamond (<span class="process-math">\(C_4\)</span>), etc. <a class="external" href="https://gifer.com/en/DKaY" target="_blank">Covalent bonding</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-37-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Ionic bond:</dfn> In ionic bonding,  electrons are transferred from one atom to another, forming positively charged cations and negatively charged anions that are attracted to each other by electrostatic forces. This bonding is most common between metals and nonmetals. For examples: in Salt molecule (<span class="process-math">\(NaCl\)</span>), Iron oxide molecule (<span class="process-math">\(Fe_2O_3\)</span>), Calcium carbonate <span class="process-math">\((CaCO3)\text{,}\)</span> magnesium oxide (<span class="process-math">\(MgO\)</span>), potassium iodide <span class="process-math">\(KI\text{,}\)</span> etc. <a class="external" href="http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1824896.htm" target="_blank">ionic bonding</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-38-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>

<dfn class="terminology">Metallic bond:</dfn> In metallic bonding,  positively charged metal ions are surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons, which are free to move throughout the metal lattice. This results in the formation of a strong metallic bond that is responsible for many of the physical properties of metals, such as their high melting points and conductivity. <a class="external" href="https://i.imgur.com/oIoEZhH.gif" target="_blank">mettalic bonding</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-39-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Molecular bonding,  typically refers to covalent bonding due to polar molecules. <a class="external" href="https://bestanimations.com/gifs/Water-Molecule.html" target="_blank">molecular bonding</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-40-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.3.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In Van der waal's bonding,  or van der Waals forces, refer to weak intermolecular attractions between molecules or atoms. These forces arise due to temporary fluctuations in the distribution of electrons in molecules or atoms.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">The type of chemical bonding that occurs between atoms is determined by the properties of the atoms involved, including their electronegativity, electron configuration, and the conditions under which the reaction occurs. Understanding chemical bonding is important in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and engineering, as it underlies the formation and properties of all types of matter.</div>
