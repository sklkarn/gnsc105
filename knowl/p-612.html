<div class="para">The valency of an element is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell of its atoms, which is also known as the valence shell. The valency of most elements can be predicted by looking at their position in the periodic table. For example, elements in Group 1 of the periodic table have a valency of 1, while elements in Group 2 have a valency of 2, and elements in Group 3 have a valency of 3. Elements in Group 15 have a valency of -3, elements in Group 16 have a valency of -2, elements in Group 17 have a valency of -1, and elements in Group 18 have a valency of 0 since they have already achieved a stable configuration. Elements in Group 14 however, have a valency of <span class="process-math">\(\pm4\)</span> as these atoms either gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons in order to obtain stable configuration.</div>
