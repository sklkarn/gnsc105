<em class="alert">Difference between molecule and compound:</em> A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. A compound is a substance made up of two or more different elements that are chemically combined in a fixed ratio. The main difference between a molecule and a compound is that a molecule is a collection of atoms that are bonded together, whereas a compound is a substance that consists of molecules made up of different elements in a fixed ratio. For example, water (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>) is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a fixed ratio of 2:1. The smallest unit of water that retains its chemical properties is a molecule of water, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom chemically bonded together. Another example is table salt (NaCl), which is a compound made up of sodium and chlorine atoms in a fixed ratio of 1:1. The smallest unit of salt that retains its chemical properties is a molecule of salt, which is made up of one sodium atom and one chlorine atom chemically bonded together.</div>
