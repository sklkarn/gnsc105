<div class="para">The stars in globular clusters are dying, just like stars in other parts of the galaxy. However, the stars in a globular cluster are generally very old, with ages typically ranging from 10 to 13 billion years, so they are in a later stage of their life cycle compared to younger stars in the galaxy. As stars age, they undergo changes in their internal structure and composition, which can cause them to evolve into different types of stars and eventually run out of fuel and die. In a globular cluster, the most massive stars have already exhausted their fuel and ended their lives, leaving behind remnants such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The remaining stars in the cluster are generally low-mass, long-lived stars like red giants, which are nearing the end of their life cycle.</div>
