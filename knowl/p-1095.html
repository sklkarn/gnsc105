<div class="para">The Andromeda Galaxy [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-andromeda.html" title="Figure 14.1.1.(c)">FigureÂ 14.1.1.(c)</a>], also known as Messier 31 or M31, is a spiral galaxy located about 2.5 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way and is the largest member of the Local Group, a group of galaxies that also includes the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and several smaller galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy is about 220,000 light-years in diameter, making it almost twice as large as the Milky Way. It contains about a trillion stars, which is more than three times the number of stars in the Milky Way. Like the Milky Way, it has a central bulge and spiral arms that wrap around it. In addition to stars, the Andromeda Galaxy also contains a variety of other celestial objects, such as globular clusters, open clusters, and nebulae. It also has a supermassive black hole at its center, which has a mass of about 100 million times that of our sun. The Andromeda Galaxy is a popular target for astronomers and amateur stargazers alike, and it can be easily seen with the naked eye from dark sky locations.</div>
