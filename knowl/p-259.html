<div class="para">Heat absorbing capacity of a material is known as specific heat capacity (or simply, <em class="alert">specific heat</em>). It is a material property. Different materials absorb different amount of heat even for the same rise of temperature. For example, if you heat an identical iron ball and an aluminum ball in the same pot for the same time duration, then you would be surprised that the aluminum ball is colder than the iron ball. This is because the specific heat of iron is less than that of aluminum. In iron, more of the heat energy spent to increase the kinetic energy of its molecules than to increase the intermolecular potential energy. Hence, the the iron has a higher temperature. The quantity of total heat transfered to the body is given by the following formula:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
Q = mc\Delta T\tag{4.1.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Where, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> stands for amount of heat required to change the temperature, <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> stands for mass of the substance, <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> stands for the specif heat capacity of the substance, and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T\)</span> stands for the temperature change (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T=T_f-T_i\)</span>). Hence  <em class="emphasis">specific heat</em> can be defined as the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 kg of the substance to <span class="process-math">\(1 ^oC\text{.}\)</span> Its SI unit is <span class="process-math">\(J/kg\cdot^oC\text{.}\)</span> The greter the specific heat of the substance, the greater would be the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature per unit mass. The higher the specific heat of the substance, the higher amount of heat it can hold. The table below shows the specific heat of some common materials.</div>
