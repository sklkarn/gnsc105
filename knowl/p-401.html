<div class="para">The space around a charge where force of attraction or repulsion can be experienced by any other charged particle is called an electric field . Electric field is also known as electrostatic field intensity. It is an inherent property of a charge. An electric field is produced by a charge and is experienced by another charge. It is an electric field of a charge which tells another charge how to move in the space if it is free to do so. Electric field is a force acting on a unit charge and is a vector quantity. <em class="alert">Electric field lines:</em> It is an imaginary path of a unit positive charge in an electric field. Electric field lines are aslo known as electric lines of force. It is always pointed radially outward for a positve charge and radially inward for a negative charge as shown in figure  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-efl.html" title="Figure 5.1.4">FigureÂ 5.1.4</a>.</div>
