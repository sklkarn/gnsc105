<div class="para">The Sun is a star that is located at the center of our solar system . It is a massive, glowing ball of gas that is about 4.6 billion years old and has a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers. The Sun is composed of mostly <em class="emphasis">hydrogen</em> (about 74% of its mass) and helium (about 24% of its mass) with trace amounts of other elements. The Sun is classified as a G-type main-sequence star, which means that it is a relatively stable and long-lived star that is in the process of fusing hydrogen [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nucfusionrxt.html" title="Figure 13.1.2.(b)">Figure 13.1.2.(b)</a>] into helium in its core. This fusion process releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is what makes the Sun shine. The Sun's magnetic field is responsible for phenomena such as <dfn class="terminology">sunspots</dfn>, [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-sunspot.html" title="Figure 13.1.2.(a)">Figure 13.1.2.(a)</a>] solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, which can have a significant impact on Earth's climate and technology. The dark patch on the sun's surface is known as sunspot. It is relatively cooler part of sun's surface due to magnetic field lines. The Sun's activity (the number of spots on the sun increases and decreases) follows an 11-year cycle, called the solar maximums and minimums.</div>
