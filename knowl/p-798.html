<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">greenhouse</dfn> is a man-made structure that is designed to grow plants in a controlled environment. It is typically made of glass or plastic panels that allow sunlight to enter while trapping heat inside, creating a warm and humid environment that is ideal for plant growth. Both greenhouse and greenhouse effect involve the trapping of heat, but the greenhouse effect occurs on a much larger scale and has much more significant consequences for the planet’s climate.</div>
