<div class="para">Carbon dating , also known as radiocarbon dating, is a method of determining the age of an object containing organic material by measuring the amount of carbon-14 it contains. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the Earth’s upper atmosphere through the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen atoms. The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has remained constant for thousands of years, so the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample can be used to determine how long it has been since the death of the organism from which the sample was taken. The carbon-14 in a sample decays over time, and the amount remaining can be measured with a specialized machine called a mass spectrometer. The age of the sample can then be calculated based on the known decay rate of carbon-14. This method is typically used to date organic materials that are less than 50,000 years old, such as archaeological artifacts, fossils, and recent organic samples. It is important to note that carbon dating has certain limitations, such as the fact that it can only be used on materials that contain organic carbon, and that the results can be affected by various factors, such as contamination and the presence of other carbon isotopes in the sample. Additionally, the method can only provide approximate ages, as the rate of decay of carbon-14 is not constant, but can be influenced by factors such as the Earth’s magnetic field and cosmic radiation. In the upper atmosphere <em class="emphasis">Cosmic rays</em> which was primarly protons turns into neutrons. These neutrons react with nitrogen to produce carbon-14.</div>

<div class="para">The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is roughly constant because the organism continuously replaces carbon-14 as it decays. However, after the organism dies, the carbon-14 in its tissues begins to decay, and the carbon-14 to carbon-12 ratio begins to change. By measuring the carbon-14 to carbon-12 ratio in a sample and comparing it to the known decay rate of carbon-14, scientists can determine how long it has been since the sample died and estimate its age.</div>
