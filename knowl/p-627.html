<div class="para">Balancing a chemical equation involves adjusting the coefficients of the reactants and products to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to balance a chemical equation:</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">Write the unbalanced equation. Identify the reactants and products and write them down using their chemical formulas.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. This will help you determine which coefficients need to be adjusted.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Begin balancing the equation by adjusting the coefficients of the compounds that contain the most atoms first. Start with the compounds that have two or more atoms of an element.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Check the number of atoms of each element again after adjusting the coefficients. Continue adjusting the coefficients until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Finally, double-check that the equation is fully balanced by counting the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.</div></li>
