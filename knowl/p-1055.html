<div class="para">A telescope  is an instrument used to study celestial objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and nebulae. It works by collecting light that is coming from the distant objects. The telescope mainly consists of a lens or a mirror to collect light, and an eyepiece or a camera to view the image. There are several types of telescopes used in astronomy, such as <dfn class="terminology">refracting telescopes [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-telesc.html" title="Figure 13.1.1.(a)">Figure 13.1.1.(a)</a>, reflecting telescopes</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-reftelsc.html" title="Figure 13.1.1.(b)">Figure 13.1.1.(b)</a>], and compound telescopes that combine both. Beside these there are also other kinds of telescope available based on what kind of electromagnetic wave is being gathered. Such as Radio telescopes: <dfn class="terminology">Radio telescopes</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-radiotelscp.html" title="Figure 13.1.1.(c)">Figure 13.1.1.(c)</a>] use radio waves to observe celestial objects. They have large dish-shaped antennas to collect radio waves and a receiver to converts the waves into electrical signals which can be analyzed. Radio telescopes are used to study radio emissions from galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and other objects. <dfn class="terminology">X-ray telescopes:</dfn> X-ray telescopes use mirrors to focus and reflect X-rays to create an image. They are typically mounted on satellites to avoid absorption by the Earth’s atmosphere. X-ray telescopes are used to study X-ray emissions from hot gas in galaxy clusters, supernova remnants, and other objects.</div>
