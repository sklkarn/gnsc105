<div class="para">Gravitational force or <dfn class="terminology">Force of Gravity:</dfn> The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(F = w = mg \text{.}\)</span> Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth.</div>
