<div class="para">The concept of physical quantity has already been introduced in <a href="sec_unit_convers.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.3: Units and Measurements">Section 1.3</a>. Here we are going to learn little more about physical quantity . As we know anything that can be measured in numbers and units are called a physical quantity. Physical quantities are of two types, namely “scalar physical quantity” (or scalars) and “vector physical quantity” (or vectors). Scalars has magnitude only and no direction is involved in this physical quantity. For example: distance, speed, mass, time, density, temperature, currency, work, energy, current, power, pressure, etc. Vectors has both magnitude and direction. For example: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, weight, momentum, torque, etc. Vector quantity is represented by an arrow pointing along its direction and size of the arrow represents its magnitude. In figure below <span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\)</span> is a vector OP which is pointing along its direction and the size of arrow is representing the magnitude of that vector. Actually, it is not logical to scale the vectors everytime we draw them on the paper, hence we distinguish the vectors just by their magnitude value and direction but not by the size of the drawing. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;"><img src="external/fig2a.png" class="contained"></div>
