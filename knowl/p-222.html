<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-fig3a.html" title="Figure 3.1.1">FigureÂ 3.1.1</a> force <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is along the direction of horizontal and the block is also displaced along the same direction from point A to point B. In this case work done by the force is given by multiplication of force <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and the displacement <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> In this figure work done by the weight <span class="process-math">\(mg\)</span> and normal force <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is zero as these forces are perpendicular to the displacement <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> However, if slanted force <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is involved in doing work, then the work is not zero but can be determined by the projected force which is not in the scope of this book. <em class="alert">Remember</em> for work to be done, foce and displacemenet must be non-zero. Work may be positive, negative, and zero. For example: work done by applied force along the direction of displacement is positive, work done by the frictional force is negative, and work done by the force perpendicular to the displacement is zero.</div>
