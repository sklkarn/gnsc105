<div class="para">According to the modern theory of atoms, solids are materials that consist of closely packed atoms or molecules that are held together by strong intermolecular forces. These intermolecular forces are created by the interactions between the electrons in the outermost energy levels or orbitals of adjacent atoms. In solids, the atoms,ions, or molecules are arranged in a specific pattern, known as a crystal lattice, which gives the solid its characteristic shape and structure. The arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice determines many of the properties of the solid, such as its density, strength, and melting point. The electrons in the outermost energy levels of the atoms in a solid are not free to move around as they are in metals, but instead are closely bound to their respective atoms. However, in some solids, such as semiconductors and metals, some electrons are free to move within the crystal lattice, and these materials can conduct electricity and heat.</div>
