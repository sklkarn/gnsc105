<div class="para">Wave  is a base to understand porperty, propagation, and nature of sound, light, heat, etc. in physics. A wave is a disturbance that travels through space and time and carries energy from one location to another. <a class="external" href="https://javalab.org/en/water_waves_en/" target="_blank">water wave</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-20-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> There are many types of waves, such as mechanical waves (e.g. sound waves and ocean waves) and electromagnetic waves (e.g. light and radio waves). Waves can have different properties, such as wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, and can exhibit phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and interference. Waves can be classified as transverse wave or longitudinal wave, depending on the direction of the oscillation of the particles that make up the wave, relative to the direction of wave propagation. Waves can also be described as periodic or aperiodic, depending on whether they have a regular or irregular pattern of oscillation. Periodic waves, such as sine and cosine waves, repeat at regular intervals, while aperiodic waves, such as noise, do not have a regular pattern of oscillation. Waves can be further classified as progressive or standing waves. Progressive waves move in one direction, e.g. a wave moving in a medium such as a rope. Standing waves do not move forward and are formed as a result of the superposition of two or more waves of the same frequency moving in opposite directions. n summary, Waves are a fundamental concept in physics that can be classified by various properties such as direction of oscillation, periodicity, and progression. You may visualize the propressive and standing wave from the following simulation. <a class="external" href="https://www.walter-fendt.de/html5/phen/standingwavereflection_en.htm" target="_blank">propagating and standing wave</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
