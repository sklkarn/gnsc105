<div class="para">Mars [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mars.html" title="Figure 12.1.5">Figure 12.1.5</a>] is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in our solar system, after Mercury. It is often referred to as the <dfn class="terminology">Red Planet</dfn> because of its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide or rust on its surface. Mars has a diameter of approximately 6,779 kilometers, which is about half the size of Earth. It has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen and argon. Mars also has the largest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system. There is evidence that <em class="emphasis">liquid water</em> once existed on Mars, and there are signs of dried-up riverbeds, lakes, and even an ancient ocean. The search for signs of life on Mars is a major focus of current and future missions. Several spacecraft, including rovers and orbiters, have been sent to Mars to study its surface, atmosphere, and geology. In 2020, NASA’s Perseverance rover successfully landed on Mars and began exploring the Jezero Crater, which is believed to have once been a lakebed and could contain evidence of past microbial life. Mars is also a target for future human exploration, with plans for manned missions and even eventual colonization. However, the harsh conditions on Mars, including its thin atmosphere and extreme temperatures, make any such missions challenging and expensive.</div>
