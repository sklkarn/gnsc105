<dfn class="terminology">Basaltic Rock:</dfn>, also known as basalt, is a type of volcanic rock that is formed from the rapid cooling and solidification of lava beneath oceanic surface. It is typically dark-colored, dense, and fine-grained. Basaltic rock is composed mainly of minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. It is one of the most common types of volcanic rocks and is found in many parts of the world. Basaltic rocks are often found in areas of volcanic activity such as mid-ocean ridges, island arcs, and hotspots. Basaltic rocks have many uses, including as a building material, a road aggregate, and as a source of crushed stone. They are also used in the construction of many types of infrastructure, such as dams and bridges. <dfn class="terminology">Granitic Rock:</dfn>, also known as granite, is a type of intrusive igneous rock that is composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals. It is a coarse-grained rock that forms from the slow cooling and solidification of magma beneath the continental crustal surface. Granite is typically light-colored and has a granular texture. It is a very durable rock and is often used as a building material for countertops, flooring, and monuments. It can also be used as a decorative stone in landscaping. Granitic rocks are found all over the world, but they are particularly common in areas with tectonic activity such as mountain ranges and volcanic regions. <dfn class="terminology">Coal</dfn> is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons. It is formed over millions of years from the remains of dead plants and animals that have been buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Coal is primarily used as a fuel for electricity generation and industrial processes, as well as for heating and cooking in some parts of the world. There are several types of coal, including anthracite, bituminous, and lignite, which vary in their carbon content and properties. Coal mining can have significant environmental impacts, such as land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. <dfn class="terminology">Limestone</dfn> is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. It forms from the accumulation of shells, coral, and other marine debris, as well as from the precipitation of calcium carbonate from water. Limestone is typically light-colored and can have a wide range of textures, from fine-grained to coarsely crystalline. It is often used as a building material and in the production of cement, lime, and other industrial materials. Limestone is also used as a decorative stone in landscaping and architecture, and can be carved into sculptures and other works of art. Some types of limestone, such as dolomite and travertine, can be formed by chemical precipitation from groundwater, rather than by the accumulation of marine debris. Limestone is vulnerable to weathering and erosion, and can be dissolved by acidic water or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, forming features such as caves, sinkholes, and limestone pavements. <dfn class="terminology">Shale</dfn> is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that is composed primarily of clay minerals, such as illite, kaolinite, and smectite, as well as other minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Shale is typically gray or black in color and has a laminated, or layered, appearance due to the parallel alignment of clay particles. It is often used as a source of oil and natural gas, as the fine-grained nature of the rock allows it to serve as a reservoir for hydrocarbons. Shale is also used as a building material, especially in regions where it is abundant. One of the unique properties of shale is its ability to split into thin, flat layers, a property known as fissility. This property makes shale useful as a building material and as a decorative stone in architecture. However, the high water content of shale can make it unstable, and it is prone to weathering and erosion over time. <dfn class="terminology">Slate</dfn> Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that is derived from shale or mudstone. It is composed primarily of clay minerals such as illite, chlorite, and muscovite, along with small amounts of quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and other minerals. Slate typically has a flat, smooth surface and is highly fissile, meaning it can be split into thin, durable sheets. It is often gray in color, but can also be green, black, or red, depending on the minerals present. Slate can be used as a roofing material, flooring, and as a decorative stone in architecture. Slate forms from the compaction and recrystallization of clay and other fine-grained sedimentary rocks under high pressure and temperature. The pressure causes the clay minerals to reorient themselves into thin, parallel layers, which gives slate its characteristic fissility (fissility is the property of a rock to split easily along thin closely spaced parallel layers). The minerals present in the original sedimentary rock, as well as the degree and duration of heat and pressure, determine the color and texture of the resulting slate. Slate is known for its durability, resistance to weathering and erosion, and fire resistance, which makes it a popular choice for roofing and other construction applications.</div>
