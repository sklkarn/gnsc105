<div class="para">Tectonic movement refers to the movement of large sections of the Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth that consists of the crust and uppermost part of the mantle) relative to each other. The lithosphere is broken up into a number of plates that move around on the underlying asthenosphere (the partially molten, ductile region of the mantle). Tectonic movement occurs primarily at plate boundaries, where plates interact with each other. There are three types of plate boundaries: <dfn class="terminology">Divergent boundaries:</dfn> where plates move away from each other, creating new crust. This occurs mainly at mid-ocean ridges. <dfn class="terminology">Convergent boundaries:</dfn> where plates move towards each other and one plate is usually subducted (forced beneath) the other. This can cause earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain-building. <dfn class="terminology">Transform boundaries:</dfn> where plates slide past each other horizontally. This can also cause earthquakes. Tectonic movement <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryrXAGY1dmE" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Plate Tectonic</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-61-hidden.html" title="Footnote 11.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>is driven by the movement of molten rock in the mantle, which creates convection currents that move the plates. The speed of plate movement can vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters per year. A <dfn class="terminology">mid-ocean ridge</dfn> is an underwater mountain range that runs along the floor of the Earth's ocean basins. It is a divergent plate boundary where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other, causing magma from the Earth's mantle to rise up and solidify, forming new oceanic crust. The mid-ocean ridge system is the longest mountain range on Earth, stretching over 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) and covering more than 23% of the Earth's surface. It is located in all of the Earth's major oceans, and its highest points are often found above sea level, forming volcanic islands. A <dfn class="terminology">volcanic eruption</dfn> is a geological event that occurs when magma, ash, and gases escape from a volcano. Volcanic eruptions can be explosive or effusive and can vary in intensity and duration. Explosive eruptions occur when a buildup of pressure causes a sudden release of gas, ash, and magma. These eruptions can be violent and destructive, sending plumes of ash and debris high into the air and causing widespread damage to surrounding areas. Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, are characterized by a steady flow of lava from the volcano. These eruptions can last for weeks, months, or even years, and can create new land by adding layers of solidified lava to the landscape.</div>
