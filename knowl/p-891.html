<div class="para">Paleontologists study fossils to understand the history of life  on Earth. They analyze the physical remains of organisms that lived in the past, such as bones, teeth, shells, and plant impressions. Fossils preserved remains or traces of past organisms that can be used to study geological events on the earth. Radiometric dating method is used to determine the age of rocks, fossils, and other geological events. By using the radiometric dating geologists are able to determine the last 542 million years of Earth’s history as the Phanerozoic eon, which is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic.</div>

<li><div class="para">The Cenozoic era is the most recent era of Earth’s history, following the Mesozoic era and spanning from 66 million years ago to the present day. It is divided into three periods: the Paleogene, the Neogene, and the Quaternary. During the Cenozoic era, the Earth underwent significant changes, including the evolution of mammals and the emergence of modern humans. The Paleogene period saw the rise of mammals after the extinction of the dinosaurs, with many groups diversifying and evolving to occupy new ecological niches. The Neogene period saw the diversification of grasses and the evolution of many modern plant and animal groups. Finally, the Quaternary period saw the evolution of modern humans and the development of human societies.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Mesozoic era is the era of geological time that spans from about 252 to 66 million years ago. It is also referred to as the Age of Reptiles because dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine reptiles dominated the planet during this time. The Mesozoic era is divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. During the Triassic period, life on land began to recover from the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which had wiped out about 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. During the Jurassic period, dinosaurs became more dominant, and the first birds evolved. The Cretaceous period saw the evolution of many new types of dinosaurs, including the tyrannosaurs and the ceratopsians. The end of the Mesozoic era is marked by the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out the dinosaurs and many other species. This event has been dated to about 66 million years ago using radiometric dating, and it is thought to have been caused by a massive asteroid impact. The extinction of the dinosaurs paved the way for the evolution of mammals and ultimately led to the emergence of modern terrestrial ecosystems.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Paleozoic era is a geological era that spanned from about 541 to 252 million years ago. It is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic eon, and it is divided into six periods: the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian periods. The Paleozoic era is characterized by significant geological and biological changes, including the emergence of complex multicellular life, the development of hard shells and skeletons, and the evolution of early fish, plants, and insects. The Cambrian explosion, which occurred during the Cambrian period, marked a rapid diversification of animal life, including the first appearance of many modern phyla. During the Paleozoic era, Earth’s continents were united in the supercontinent of Pangaea, which began to break up during the Mesozoic era. The Paleozoic era ended with the Permian extinction event, which wiped out about 95% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. The cause of this extinction event is still debated, but it is thought to have been caused by a combination of volcanic activity, climate change, and asteroid impacts.</div></li>
