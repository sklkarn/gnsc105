<div class="para">Gravitational force or <dfn class="terminology">Force of Gravity:</dfn> The gravitational force exists due to the mass of an object. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It holds all the planets together. We discuss this force later in this section. This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., Foece, <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> = weight = <span class="process-math">\(mg\text{.}\)</span> Where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. <dfn class="terminology">Weight:</dfn> It is the force acting on an object due to gravitational acceleration. Weight is the effect of force of gravity on an object located at a particular point. One kg of mass has a weight of about 10 N (<span class="process-math">\(F = 1 kg\times 9.8 m/s^2 \approx 10N\)</span>).</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_second-force.html#li-83" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
