<dfn class="terminology">Equinoxes</dfn> occur twice a year, around March 20-21 and September 22-23, and mark the points in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun when the tilt of the Earth’s axis is not inclined towards or away from the Sun. During the March equinox, which marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, the plane of the Earth’s equator passes through the center of the Sun, resulting in equal amounts of daylight and darkness all over the world. During the September equinox, which marks the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and spring in the Southern Hemisphere, the plane of the Earth’s equator passes through the center of the Sun again, resulting in another day of equal daylight and darkness all over the world.</div>
