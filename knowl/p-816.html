<dfn class="terminology">Erosion by running water</dfn> is one of the most common types of erosion and occurs when rainwater or surface runoff flows over land and picks up soil particles, which are then transported downstream. The amount of erosion by running water depends on several factors such as the velocity of the water, the amount of rainfall, and the characteristics of the soil or rock being eroded. High-velocity water, such as that found in rivers and streams, can cause significant erosion by carrying large quantities of sediment downstream. Over time, erosion by running water can cause significant changes to the landscape, including the formation of valleys and other landforms. It can also lead to soil degradation, loss of vegetation, and the deposition of sediment in water bodies, which can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems.</div>
