<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">spring</dfn> is a natural water source that flows from the ground to the surface. Springs occur when groundwater, which is water stored beneath the Earthâ€™s surface in soil, sediment, or rocks, becomes saturated and flows out to the surface. The location and flow of springs are determined by the geology of the area, including the types of rocks and sediments present, as well as the amount of rainfall and the shape of the land. Springs are important sources of freshwater for human consumption and are also critical habitats for many plant and animal species. Springs can be classified into several types based on the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer that they originate from, including artesian springs, seepage springs, and karst springs.</div>
