<div class="para">Auroras, also known as the Northern or Southern Lights, are natural phenomena that occur in the Earth's upper atmosphere when charged particles from the Sun interact with the Earth's magnetic field. The Sun constantly releases a stream of charged particles, known as the solar wind, into space. When the solar wind encounters the Earth's magnetic field, it can cause the field lines to become distorted and create a region of charged particles trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere. Some of these particles, primarily electrons and protons, are funneled down towards the Earth's polar regions by the Earth's magnetic field. When these charged particles collide with the gases in the Earth's upper atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen, they can excite the atoms and molecules, causing them to emit light. This produces the colorful and shimmering displays of light known as auroras. Green color auroras are produced by excited oxygen atoms at lower altitude in the atmosphere, while red auroras are produced by excited oxygen molecules at higher altitudes. The pink or purple hues that sometimes appear in the aurora are caused by the collision of charged particles with nitrogen molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. <dfn class="terminology">Note:</dfn> The term "aurora borealis" specifically refers to the northern lights, which are visible in the northern hemisphere. The term "aurora australis" refers to the southern lights, which are visible in the southern hemisphere.</div>
