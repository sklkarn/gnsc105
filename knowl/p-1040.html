<div class="para">The phrase <em class="emphasis">OBA Fine Girl (Guy) Kiss Me</em> is a mnemonic to remember the spectral sequence of stars from hottest to coolest, which corresponds to the order of spectral types <dfn class="terminology">O, B, A, F, G, K,</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">M</dfn>. O-type stars are blue and located on the upper left of the diagram, while M-type stars are red and located on the lower right. Our <dfn class="terminology">Sun</dfn> is classified as a G-type star, which is a main-sequence star that has a surface temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). G-type stars like the Sun have a yellow-white color and are located in the middle of the HR diagram.</div>
