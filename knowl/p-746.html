<dfn class="terminology">Concentration:</dfn> The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute dissolved in a specific amount of solvent or solution. The term <em class="emphasis">"saturated"</em> and <em class="emphasis">"unsaturated"</em> are used to describe the concentration of solute in a solution. A <dfn class="terminology">saturated</dfn> solution contains maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. No more solute can be dissolved in the solvent of the saturated solution without increasing the temperature or pressure. Any additional solute added to the solution will not dissolve and will remain as a solid. On the other hand, an <dfn class="terminology">unsaturated</dfn>   solution contains less than the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. In an unsaturated solution, more solute can be added and dissolved in the solvent. Itâ€™s important to note that a solution can also be <dfn class="terminology">supersaturated</dfn> , which means it contains more solute than what can theoretically be dissolved at a given temperature and pressure. Supersaturated solutions are not stable and can spontaneously crystallize, forming a precipitate, or solid, out of excess solute.</div>
