<div class="para">There are also several types of solutions based on the phases of the solute and solvent. Here are some common types of solutions:</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Solid-solid solutions:</dfn> It is also known as solid solutions or alloys, are homogeneous mixtures of two or more solid elements or compounds. In a solid solution, the atoms of one component are dispersed uniformly throughout the crystal lattice of the other component, resulting in a single, continuous phase. Examples of solid-solid solutions include brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc; steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon; and bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Liquid-liquid solutions:</dfn> These are solutions in which the solute and solvent are both liquids. Examples include milk in water, ethanol in water, and benzene in toluene.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Gas-liquid solutions:</dfn> also known as gas solutions. These are solutions in which the solute is a gas that dissolves in a liquid solvent. Examples include cold drink, carbon dioxide in water, oxygen in blood, and nitrogen in beer.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Solid-liquid solutions:</dfn> Here solid is solute and liquid is solvent. For example: salt water solution, sugar water solution.</div></li>
