<div class="para">Objects moving under the influence of gravity only is called a free fall. This means gravity causes a change in the velocity of any object by 9.80 <span class="process-math">\(m/s\)</span> every second. So, drop any object and let it fall toward the ground: After 1s, the speed of the object is 9.80 <span class="process-math">\(m/s\text{.}\)</span> After 2s, the speed of the object is 19.6 <span class="process-math">\(m/s\text{.}\)</span> Etc. According to Galileo the velocity of a falling object is proportional to the length of time that the object has been falling. From the first equation of motion <span class="process-math">\(v_f-v_i=gt\)</span> or, <span class="process-math">\(v=gt, \)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\quad \therefore v\propto t, 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">as <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a constant. Hence, the object is falling with higher velocity if it is falling for a long time or from a higher position. Since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is constant near the planet all objects fall at the same rate. (Assuming there is no air resistance).</div>
