<div class="para">Hydrogen gas is made out of <span class="process-math">\(H_2\)</span> molecules. It is not a compound. Oxygen gas is made out of <span class="process-math">\(O_2\)</span> molecules and is also not a compound. They are made out of two atoms of the same element. Similarly, Ozone gas (<span class="process-math">\(O_3\)</span>), nitrogen gas (<span class="process-math">\(N_2\)</span>), chlorine substance (<span class="process-math">\(Cl_2\)</span>) are molecule. However, carbon dioxide gas (<span class="process-math">\(CO_2\)</span>) is a compound and molecule both, similarly, amonia (<span class="process-math">\(NH_3\)</span>) is a compound and molecule both. Because they are made out of two different elements. Meaning all compounds are molecules but all molecules are not compounds.</div>
