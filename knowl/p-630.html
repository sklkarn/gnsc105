<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">base</dfn> is a substance that can accept a proton <span class="process-math">\((H^+)\)</span> from another substance or donate a hydroxide ion <span class="process-math">\((OH^-)\)</span> to another substance. Bases can be classified as either strong or weak, depending on their ability to dissociate in water. A <dfn class="terminology">strong base</dfn> is a base that completely dissociates in water, meaning that all of its molecules break apart into ions. Examples of strong bases include sodium hydroxide <span class="process-math">\((NaOH)\text{,}\)</span> potassium hydroxide <span class="process-math">\((KOH)\text{,}\)</span> and calcium hydroxide <span class="process-math">\((Ca(OH)_2)\text{.}\)</span> These bases have a very high pH and are highly reactive. A <dfn class="terminology">weak base</dfn>, on the other hand, only partially dissociates in water, meaning that only a small fraction of its molecules break apart into ions. Examples of weak bases include ammonia <span class="process-math">\((NH_3)\text{,}\)</span> pyridine <span class="process-math">\((C_5H_5N)\text{,}\)</span> and trimethylamine <span class="process-math">\((N(CH_3)_3)\text{.}\)</span> These bases have a lower pH than strong bases and are less reactive. The strength of a base is determined by its dissociation constant (Kb), which is a measure of how easily the base accepts a proton from water. A high Kb value indicates a strong base, while a low Kb value indicates a weak base. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>
