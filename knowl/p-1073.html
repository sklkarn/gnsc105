<div class="para">A black hole [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-blackholes.html" title="Figure 13.2.5">Figure 13.2.5</a>]  is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion and collapsed under their own gravity. If the collapsing object is larger than about 3 times the mass of the Sun, the gravitational forces become so strong that not even neutrons can resist the collapse, and a black hole is formed. They have no surface or structure, but instead are characterized by their mass, spin, and electric charge. The mass of a black hole can range from a few times that of the Sun to billions of times that of the Sun. The region around a black hole where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape is called the <dfn class="terminology">event horizon.</dfn> Once matter crosses the event horizon, it is trapped by the black hole and cannot escape. The point at the center of a black hole where the gravitational pull becomes infinite is called the <dfn class="terminology">singularity</dfn>, and our current understanding of physics breaks down at this point. Black holes are invisible, as they do not emit any light or other forms of radiation. However, their presence can be inferred from the effects of their gravity on nearby matter. For example, if a black hole is in a binary star system, its gravity can cause the visible star to wobble, and the mass of the black hole can be estimated from the size of the wobble. As a black hole pulls matter into it, the matter gets accelerated and emits radiation that can be detected by telescopes. This radiation can come from the <dfn class="terminology">accretion disk</dfn> around the black hole [<a href="subsec-Quasars.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 14.1.7: Quasars">Subsection 14.1.7</a>], where matter gets heated up and emits X-rays and other high-energy radiation.</div>
