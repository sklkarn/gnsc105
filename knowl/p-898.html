<dfn class="terminology">Basaltic Rock:</dfn>, (or basalt) is a volcanic rock that is formed from the rapid cooling and solidification of lava beneath oceanic surface. It is typically dark-colored, dense, and <em class="emphasis">fine-grained rock</em>. It is one of the most common types of volcanic rocks found in many parts of the world. Basalts are often found in areas of volcanic activity such as mid-ocean ridges, island arcs, and hotspots. Basalts can be used as a building material, a road aggregate, and as a source of crushed stone.</div>
