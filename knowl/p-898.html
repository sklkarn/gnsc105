<dfn class="terminology">Granitic Rock:</dfn>, (or granite) is an intrusive igneous rock that is composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals. It is a <em class="emphasis">coarse-grained rock</em> that forms from the slow cooling and solidification of magma beneath the continental crustal surface. Granite is typically light-colored and has a granular texture. It is a very durable rock and is often used as a building material for countertops, flooring, and monuments. It can also be used as a decorative stone in landscaping. Granitic rocks are found all over the world, but they are particularly common in areas with tectonic activity such as mountain ranges and volcanic regions.</div>
