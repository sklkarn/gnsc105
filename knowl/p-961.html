<div class="para">A globular cluster  is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core, as opposed to being part of a galaxy's disk like most stars. Globular clusters are typically very old, with ages ranging from 10 to 13 billion years, and they are some of the oldest known objects in the universe. They are also some of the most densely packed objects in the universe, with hundreds of thousands to millions of stars packed tightly together in a region just a few dozen light-years across. Globular clusters are generally thought to have formed early in the history of their host galaxies, when the universe was still relatively young and gas-rich. The intense gravitational forces in the center of the cluster caused the gas and dust to collapse and form stars, which eventually settled into a dense, spherical cluster. Globular clusters are important objects for astronomers to study because they provide clues about the early history and formation of galaxies. By studying the properties of the stars in a globular cluster, astronomers can learn about the conditions in which the stars formed and how they have evolved over time. Globular clusters are also used as standard candles for measuring the distance to galaxies, which helps astronomers to understand the large-scale structure of the universe.</div>
