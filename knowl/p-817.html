<div class="para">The thin atmosphere of Mars does not provide significant protection from the sun's radiation and solar wind, which means that the planet's surface is bombarded by high-energy particles. However, the atmosphere does help to regulate the planet's temperature and weather patterns. The temperature on Mars can vary greatly, ranging from an average of about -63°C (-81°F) at the equator to as low as -143°C (-225°F) at the poles during the winter. During the summer, temperatures can reach a maximum of around 20°C (68°F) at the equator. The Martian atmosphere also contains clouds, dust storms, and seasonal weather patterns. Dust storms can sometimes cover the entire planet and can last for weeks or even months, affecting the solar-powered rovers and landers that are exploring the surface.</div>
