<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">ozone hole</dfn> refers to a severe depletion of the ozone layer in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere over the Antarctic region, which occurs annually during September to November. The depletion is caused by the release of man-made chemicals, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and other halogenated gases that have been used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other industrial applications. These chemicals are transported into the upper atmosphere, where they are broken down by ultraviolet radiation from the sun, releasing chlorine and bromine atoms. These atoms then react with ozone molecules, breaking them down into oxygen molecules and causing a significant depletion of the ozone layer.</div>
