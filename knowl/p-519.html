<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">atom</dfn> is the basic building block of matter. It defines the structure of elements. In Greek "atom" means indivisible. It was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be further divided. However, we now know that atoms are made up of very tiny particles, electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number of protons in a nucleus of an atom determines the name of the element. Atoms bond together to form molecules and make up all matter in the universe. They play a crucial role in chemical reactions, combustion, and the transmission of signals in living organisms. The study of atoms is called atomic physics. J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897 and showed that atoms were made up of negatively charged particles. Ernest Rutherford demonstrated that atoms also contain a positive nucleus, in 1909. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model for the atomic structure that explained the periodic table and the spectra of light. Throughout the <span class="process-math">\(20^{th}\)</span>  century, lots of studies were done for atoms and their components, which lead to the development of quantum mechanics and a deeper understanding of atomic behavior.</div>
