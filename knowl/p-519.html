<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">atom</dfn> is the basic building block of matter. It defines the structure of elements. The name "atom" is taken from the Greek which means indivisible. It was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in nature and could not be further divisible. However, we now know that atoms are made up of very tiny particles, electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number of protons in a nucleus of an atom determines the name of the element. Atoms bond together to form molecules and make up all matter in the universe. Atoms play a crucial role in chemical reactions. The study of atoms is called the atomic physics. Many discoveries had been made throughout the <span class="process-math">\(20^{th}\)</span>  century to understand the structure of atom and its behavior.</div>
