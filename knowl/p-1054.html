<div class="para">Observational astronomy is the branch of astronomy that deals with observing celestial objects and phenomena using telescopes and other instruments. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data obtained from observations of the sky. A wide range of objects such as stars, galaxies, planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies are studied under observational astronomy. Observational astronomers use telescopes, cameras, and other instruments to collect data and analyze them to draw conclusions about the nature of celestial objects. They gather data for visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation that are coming from these objects. They may also use computer simulations to better understand what they observe.</div>
