<div class="para">The Sun is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, which together make up over 99% of its mass. Other elements present in smaller amounts include oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, and nitrogen, among others. Calcium is a relatively abundant element in the universe and is the fifth most abundant element in the Sun by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon. Calcium in the Sun’s atmosphere can be detected through its characteristic absorption lines in the Sun’s spectrum [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-solarspectra.html" title="Figure 13.1.2.(c)">Figure 13.1.2.(c)</a>], which are produced by the absorption of specific wavelengths of light by the calcium atoms in the Sun’s outer layers. These elements are created through nuclear fusion processes that occur in the Sun’s core. As the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium, the byproducts of this process can go on to create heavier elements, which eventually settle into the Sun’s interior.</div>
