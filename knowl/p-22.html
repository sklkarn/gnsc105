<div class="para">Physics endeavors to decipher natural laws. In order to describe a natural law (or physical law) a measurement of varieties of physical quantities are essential.  Measurement is a process that uses numbers and units to describe a physical quantity based on what can be observed. A physical property which can be quantified and measured in numbers and units is called a  physical quantity. Length, mass, time, weight, temperature, density, speed, velocity, etc are physical quantities. Emotions, angers, feelings, appearances, etc which can not be quantized are not considered as physical quantities. In order to measure physical quantities some standard measures (or standards) must be defined on which everyone can agree. Standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement. We can measure things by compering them with the standards. Units of measurement provide standards for comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. A meter stick is an example of a standard. When something is measured with a meterstick, we compare their similar property with the meterstick. For example, if we measure a height of a pillar with a meterstick and found that height to be 6 meter then 6 is a number of times meterstick used in the measurement and meter is a unit (or length) of meterstick. This makes measurement easier and uniform.</div>
