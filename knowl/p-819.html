<div class="para">Water is found in various forms on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, glaciers, groundwater, and atmospheric water vapor. The vast majority of Earth’s water is contained in the oceans, which cover about 70% of the planet’s surface. The remaining water is found in freshwater sources such as lakes, rivers, and groundwater. <dfn class="terminology">Groundwater</dfn> refers to water that is stored beneath the Earth’s surface in porous rock or soil. Groundwater is replenished through processes such as precipitation and infiltration, which cause water to percolate down through soil and rock layers until it reaches an impermeable layer, such as bedrock. Groundwater can also discharge into surface water bodies such as lakes and rivers, providing a source of water for these ecosystems.</div>
