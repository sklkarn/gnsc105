<div class="para">During a <dfn class="terminology">New Moon</dfn>, the Moon is located between the <dfn class="terminology">Earth and the Sun</dfn>, and the side of the Moon that faces Earth is not illuminated by the Sun, making it invisible from Earth. When the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun during a New Moon, a solar eclipse can occur, temporarily blocking out the Sun's light and casting a shadow on the Earth. On the other hand, a <dfn class="terminology">full moon</dfn> occurs when the Earth is located between the <dfn class="terminology">Sun and the Moon</dfn>, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing Earth. It's worth noting that a lunar eclipse can only occur during a Full Moon phase, when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon may appear reddish in color due to the Earth's atmosphere refracting sunlight onto the Moon's surface.</div>
