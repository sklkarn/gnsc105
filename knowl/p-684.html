<dfn class="terminology">Cyclones and Anticyclones</dfn> Cyclones and anticyclones are weather systems that are characterized by areas of low and high pressure, respectively. These systems are important for understanding and predicting weather patterns. <dfn class="terminology">Cyclones</dfn> are areas of low pressure that are typically associated with clouds, precipitation, and stormy weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, cyclones rotate counterclockwise and move in a west to east direction, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate clockwise and move in an east to west direction. Cyclones are commonly referred to as hurricanes, typhoons, or tropical storms when they occur over warm ocean waters. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-cycantcyc.html" title="Figure 10.2.2">FigureÂ 10.2.2</a>.</div>
