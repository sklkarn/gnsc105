<div class="para">The dual nature of light refers that light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behavior, which was first described by the wave-particle duality theory in quantum mechanics. This theory states that light can behave as both a wave and a particle depending on the experimental setup used to observe it. For example, in the double-slit experiment, light behaves as a wave, but in the photoelectric effect, it behaves as particles, called photons. The dual nature of light is still not fully understood and remains one of the most intriguing concepts in physics. In the double-slit experiment, light passing through two slits interferes with itself, creating a characteristic pattern on a screen behind the slits, which is typical of wave behavior. However, when light is emitted from a source and detected one photon at a time, the photons are found to behave as particles and follow a random path through the slits, not forming any interference pattern. <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvzSLByrw4Q" target="_blank">Duality</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>
