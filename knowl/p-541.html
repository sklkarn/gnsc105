<div class="para">A chemical equation  is a representation of a chemical reaction using symbols and formulas to show the reactants and products involved in the reaction. Chemical equations are written in a balanced form, meaning that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. This is because the law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, only rearranged. The general form of a chemical equation is: <dfn class="terminology">Reactants â†’ Products</dfn> For example, the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This equation shows that two molecules of hydrogen gas <span class="process-math">\((H_2)\)</span> react with one molecule of oxygen gas <span class="process-math">\((O_2)\)</span> to form two molecules of water <span class="process-math">\((H_2O)\text{.}\)</span> The equation is balanced because there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation.</div>
