<div class="para">One of the most important properties of acids and bases is their <span class="process-math">\(pH\)</span> level. The <dfn class="terminology">pH scale</dfn> is a measurement system used to describe the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. It is a logarithmic scale that ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being <em class="emphasis">neutral</em>. A solution with a pH less than 7 is considered <em class="emphasis">acidic</em>, while a solution with a pH greater than 7 is considered <em class="emphasis">basic</em> (alkaline). The strength of an acid or base depends on its ability to release or accept hydrogen ions. Each unit on the pH scale represents a tenfold difference in acidity or basicity. For example, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 6. Similarly, a solution with a pH of 10 is ten times more basic than a solution with a pH of 9, and 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 8. The pH scale is important in many scientific fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science. It is used to measure the acidity or basicity of substances such as water, soil, and blood.</div>
