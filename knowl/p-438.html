<div class="para">There are over 3,000 known isotopes in the periodic table, but not all of them are naturally occurring. Some isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, while others are radioactive and decay over time. The number of isotopes of an element can vary greatly, with some elements having only one or two isotopes, while others have many. The lightest element <em class="alert">hydrogen</em> has three isotopes <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-isotope.html" title="Figure 7.2.1">FigureÂ 7.2.1</a>. They are Hydrogen: <span class="process-math">\({}_1^1H\text{,}\)</span> Deuterium: <span class="process-math">\({}_1^2H\text{,}\)</span> and Tritium: <span class="process-math">\({}_1^3H\text{.}\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">Heavy water</dfn> is a type of water molecule that contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (H-2) instead of the common hydrogen isotope (H-1). Heavy water has the same chemical properties as regular water <span class="process-math">\((H_2O)\text{,}\)</span> but its physical properties, such as boiling and melting points, are slightly different. Heavy water is used in various industrial and scientific applications, including nuclear reactors, where it serves as a moderator to slow down the speed of neutrons in the reactor core.</div>
