<dfn class="terminology">Quasars</dfn> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-accretiondisk.html" title="Figure 13.2.6">FigureÂ 13.2.6</a>] are some of the brightest and most energetic objects in the universe. They are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes that are actively accreting matter. As the matter falls towards the black hole, it heats up and emits intense radiation that can outshine entire galaxies. Subsequent observations revealed that quasars were located at extreme distances, billions of light-years away. Quasars are associated with massive galaxies in the early universe. As gas falls towards the central black hole, it also triggers the formation of stars and the growth of the galaxy. Quasars are thus thought to be crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.</div>
