<dfn class="terminology">Blackbody radiation</dfn> is the theoretical description of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect blackbody, which is an object that absorbs all radiation falling on it and reflects none. In 1900, Max Planck proposed a theoretical model to explain the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation, which was in agreement with experimental observations. Planck’s model proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets, called quanta, rather than continuous. <dfn class="terminology">Quanta</dfn> is the plural form of quantum (in Latin, quantum means how much). The higher the frequency of the light, the more the energy per quantum. This was a major departure from classical physics and marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. Planck’s work laid the foundation for the understanding of the nature of light and electromagnetic radiation and has had a profound impact on modern physics. The study of blackbody radiation helps understand the nature of heat and light.</div>
