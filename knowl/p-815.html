<div class="para">Water is found in various forms on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, glaciers, groundwater, and atmospheric water vapor. The Earth’s water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, involves the continuous movement of water between these different forms, driven by processes such as evaporation, precipitation, and transpiration. The vast majority of Earth’s water is contained in the oceans, which cover about 70% of the planet’s surface. The remaining water is found in freshwater sources such as lakes, rivers, and groundwater. <dfn class="terminology">Groundwater</dfn> refers to water that is stored beneath the Earth’s surface in porous rock or soil. It is an important source of freshwater for many people around the world and plays a crucial role in the Earth’s hydrologic cycle. Groundwater is replenished through processes such as precipitation and infiltration, which cause water to percolate down through soil and rock layers until it reaches an impermeable layer, such as bedrock. The water is stored in the pores and fractures of the rock or soil, forming an aquifer. The amount of water that can be stored in an <em class="emphasis">aquifer</em> depends on several factors, including the porosity and permeability of the rock or soil, the amount of rainfall or recharge, and the rate of extraction. Groundwater is often accessed through wells, which are drilled into the aquifer to extract water. Groundwater can also discharge into surface water bodies such as lakes and rivers, providing a source of water for these ecosystems. However, overuse of groundwater can lead to depletion of the aquifer, which can have negative impacts on human water supplies and natural ecosystems. Groundwater can also become contaminated through human activities such as agriculture, mining, and waste disposal, which can have negative impacts on human health and the environment.</div>
