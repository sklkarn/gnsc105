<div class="para">Ocean basins are bounded by continental landmasses. Ocean bottom generally slopes downward from the <dfn class="terminology">continental shelves</dfn> to the deeper ocean basins. This slope is known as the <dfn class="terminology">continental slope</dfn> and is usually steeper than the continental shelf. The slope continues down to the deep-sea floor, which is generally characterized by a flat plain known as the <dfn class="terminology">abyssal plain</dfn>. <dfn class="terminology">Continental shelves</dfn> are areas of the ocean floor that extend from the continents and are covered by shallow water <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-basin.html" title="Figure 10.3.1">FigureÂ 10.3.1</a>. They are part of the continental crust that is submerged below sea level, and they slope gradually downward from the shorelines to the deeper ocean basins. The <dfn class="terminology">ocean floor</dfn> is the bottom of the ocean which characterizes mountains, trenches, ridges, and plains.</div>
