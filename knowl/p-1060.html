<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</dfn> or HR diagram  is a graphical representation of the relationship between a star’s luminosity (or brightness) and temperature, and it provides a way to classify stars based on their properties. Using the HR diagram, astronomers can determine where a star is in its life cycle, from its birth as a protostar, through its evolution on the main sequence, to its eventual death as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. HR diagram helps to categorize and analyze the properties of stars at different stages in their evolution. Here’s how to read the HR diagram <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hrdiagram.html" title="Figure 13.2.1.(a)">Figure 13.2.1.(a)</a>:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Temperature:</dfn> The horizontal axis of the HR diagram shows the temperature of stars, with the hottest stars on the left and the coolest stars on the right. The temperature is usually measured in units of Kelvin (K) or degrees Celsius (°C).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Luminosity:</dfn> The vertical axis of the HR diagram shows the luminosity (or brightness) of stars, with the most luminous stars at the top and the least luminous stars at the bottom. The luminosity is usually measured in units of solar luminosity, which is the amount of energy emitted by the Sun.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Main sequence:</dfn> The main sequence is a diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right of the HR diagram. This band represents the majority of stars in the universe, including our Sun. The stars on the main sequence are fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Red giants and supergiants:</dfn> Above and to the right of the main sequence are red giants and supergiants. These stars are much more luminous than main sequence stars but have lower surface temperatures.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">White dwarfs:</dfn> Below and to the left of the main sequence are white dwarfs. These stars are much less luminous than main sequence stars but have higher surface temperatures.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Stellar evolution:</dfn> By looking at where a star is located on the HR diagram, astronomers can determine its stage of evolution. For example, a star that has moved off the main sequence and is located in the region of red giants is nearing the end of its life and is fusing heavier elements in its core.</div></li>
