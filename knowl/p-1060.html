<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">black dwarf</dfn> is a hypothetical type of stellar remnant that is formed when a white dwarf, the final stage of stellar evolution for low-mass stars like the Sun, cools down and no longer emits significant amounts of light or heat. The formation of a black dwarf is a very slow process that would take trillions of years to occur. As the white dwarf cools down, it would lose its heat energy and become increasingly dimmer until it no longer emits any light. At this point, it would be considered a black dwarf. However, no black dwarfs are thought to exist in the universe yet, because the time required for a white dwarf to cool down to this state is much longer than the current age of the universe. The universe is currently estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old, which is not enough time for a white dwarf to cool down and become a black dwarf.</div>
