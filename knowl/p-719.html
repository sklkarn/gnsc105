<dfn class="terminology">Crystalline Solids:</dfn> These are solids with a regular, repeating pattern of atoms, molecules or ions arranged in a three-dimensional lattice structure. The lattice structure gives the solid its characteristic properties, such as melting point, hardness, and conductivity. Crystalline solids can be further classified into two subtypes: molecular crystals, where the repeating units are molecules, and atomic crystals, where the repeating units are atoms. Examples of atomic crystals are diamond, salt, iron, copper, etc. Examples of molecular crystals are ice, quartz, sugar, and organic crystals such as caffeine, aspirin, and cholesterol, etc. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nacl.html" title="Figure 9.0.1.(a)">Figure 9.0.1.(a)</a>

<dfn class="terminology">Amorphous Solids:</dfn> These are solids without a regular lattice structure. In <em class="emphasis">Greek</em> amorphous means "without form". The arrangement of particles in amorphous solids is random and disordered. Examples include glass, rubber, and plastic. <em class="emphasis">Glass</em> is amorphous because its atoms or molecules do not have a regular or periodic arrangement. Unlike crystalline solids, which have a well-defined lattice structure, the arrangement of particles in glass is random and disordered. The amorphous nature of glass arises due to the way it is formed. Glass is typically made by cooling a molten liquid too quickly for its atoms or molecules to arrange themselves into a regular lattice structure. As a result, the particles in glass are frozen in a random arrangement, leading to an amorphous solid. This amorphous nature of glass gives it some unique properties, such as being transparent, brittle, and having a relatively low melting point compared to crystalline solids. The lack of a defined structure also means that glass can be easily molded into a variety of shapes, making it useful in many applications such as windows, lenses, and optical fibers. However, the lack of a defined structure also makes glass more prone to fractures and cracking, as the random arrangement of particles makes it difficult for the material to dissipate stress and strain. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-amorps.html" title="Figure 9.0.1.(b)">Figure 9.0.1.(b)</a>
