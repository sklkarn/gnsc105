It seems that the sun is revolving around the earth. On such observation the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD came up with the idea of “Geocentric Theory” in which unmoving earth is at the center of the universe and the sun is revolving around it.

However, his theory was not able to explain “Retrograde Motion” correctly.</div>
