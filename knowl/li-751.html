</h4>Oceanic-continental plate collision: When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate is usually subducted, or forced beneath the less dense continental plate. This process can lead to the formation of subduction zones, where the oceanic plate is forced downward into the mantle, creating a deep oceanic <dfn class="terminology">trench</dfn> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-trenchridge.html" title="Figure 11.4.1">Figure 11.4.1</a>. As the oceanic plate is subducted, it heats up and begins to melt, forming magma that rises to the surface and can lead to volcanic activity. This volcanic activity can create a line of volcanoes known as a volcanic arc on the continental plate side of the subduction zone. The collision between the oceanic and continental plates can also cause folding and faulting of the continental crust, leading to the formation of mountain ranges. The collision can also cause earthquakes as the plates grind against each other and release energy. One well-known example of an oceanic-continental plate collision is the Andes Mountains in South America.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-tectmov.html#li-751" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
