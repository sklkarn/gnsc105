<div class="para">There are several types of solutions, based on their composition and properties. Here are some common types of solutions:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Homogeneous solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that have uniform composition and properties throughout. The solute particles are evenly distributed in the solvent. Examples include saltwater, sugar water, and ethanol-water mixtures.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Heterogeneous solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that have non-uniform composition and properties. The solute particles are not evenly distributed in the solvent. Examples include suspensions, emulsions, and colloids.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Dilute solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that have a low concentration of solute. The amount of solute is relatively small compared to the amount of solvent. Examples include a drop of food coloring in a glass of water or a pinch of salt in a pot of soup.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Concentrated solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that have a high concentration of solute. The amount of solute is relatively large compared to the amount of solvent. Examples include concentrated sulfuric acid, concentrated sodium hydroxide, and concentrated ammonia solutions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Saturated solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that contain the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. Any additional solute added to the solution will not dissolve and will remain as a solid. Examples include sugar-water solutions and saltwater solutions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Unsaturated solutions:</dfn>  These are solutions that contain less than the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a particular temperature and pressure. More solute can be added to the solution and dissolved. Examples include weak tea and weak coffee.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Supersaturated solutions:</dfn> These are solutions that contain more solute than what can theoretically dissolve at a given temperature and pressure. These solutions are not stable and can spontaneously crystallize, forming a precipitate or solid out of excess solute. Examples include supersaturated sugar-water solutions and supersaturated sodium acetate solutions.</div></li>
