<div class="para">The Bohr model of the atom is a simplified representation of the structure of an atom proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. According to the Bohr model, an atom consists of a central nucleus composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons surrounded by electrons in shells or orbits. The electrons occupy discrete energy levels and move in circular orbits around the nucleus, and the energy of an electron depends on its distance from the nucleus. The quantized orbits correspond to specific energy levels, and the transition of an electron from one energy level to another results in the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation, which is observed as a spectral line. The Bohr model helps explain the emission and absorption spectra of atoms and laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics. The Bohr model is used to describe the structure of hydrogen energy levels.

The movement of electrons between these energy levels produces a spectrum.</div>
