<dfn class="terminology">Energy:</dfn>  The capacity of doing work by a force is called an energy. It is also a scalar quantity and has the same unit as work. There are many forms of energy, but they all fall into two categories: potential energy and kinetic energy. These energies are also called a mechanical energy. Potential energy is the energy of position of the object. It is also a stored energy on the object which is equal to the work done on the object to bring it to this position. There are several forms of potential energy, including: gravitational potential energy, chemical energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, sound energy, heat energy, light energy, geothermal energy, etc. <em class="emphasis">Chemical energy:</em> It is energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. It is the energy that holds these particles together. Foods, biomass, petroleum, and natural gas are some examples of stored chemical energy. During photosynthesis, sunlight gives plants the energy they need to build complex chemical compounds. When these compounds are later broken down, the stored chemical energy is released as heat, light, motion, and sound. <em class="emphasis">Elastic energy:</em> It is an energy stored in objects by the application of a restoring force. Compressed springs and stretched rubber bands are examples of elastic energy. <em class="emphasis">Nuclear energy:</em> It is an energy stored in the nucleus of an atom that binds the nucleus together. The energy can be released when the nuclei are combined or split apart. Nuclear power plants split the nuclei of uranium atoms in a process called fission reaction . The sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion reaction . In both the fission and fusion reactions, mass is converted into energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy</div>

It is the work done in lifting an object against gravity near the earth's surface. Gravitational Potential energy depends only on the distance from the ground, not on the object's motion.

A rock resting at the top of a hill contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. In hydropower dam, water in the reservoir stored a gravitational potential energy. <em class="alert">Kinetic energy:</em> It is the energy of a body due to its motion.
