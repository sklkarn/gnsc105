<dfn class="terminology">Precambrian time:</dfn> The Precambrian is a geological eon that spans from about 4.6 billion years ago to approximately 541 million years ago, which is the beginning of the Phanerozoic eon. It is divided into three eras: the Hadean, the Archean, and the Proterozoic. During the Hadean era, the Earth was formed and underwent intense geological activity, including volcanic eruptions, meteorite impacts, and the formation of the oceans and atmosphere. The first life forms may have emerged during this time. The Archean era saw the emergence of the first prokaryotic cells, as well as the formation of the continents and the stabilization of the Earthâ€™s crust. Cyanobacteria, which are photosynthetic bacteria, also emerged during this era and started to produce oxygen, which changed the composition of the atmosphere. The Proterozoic era saw the emergence of eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus and other organelles, as well as the evolution of multicellular organisms. This era also saw the development of complex ecosystems and the first appearance of animals.</div>
