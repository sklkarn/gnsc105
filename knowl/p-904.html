<dfn class="terminology">Laurasia and Gondwana</dfn> were two supercontinents that existed during the Mesozoic Era, between approximately 252 million to 66 million years ago. Laurasia was a northern supercontinent that consisted of present-day North America, Europe, and Asia (excluding India and Arabia). It formed during the Late Paleozoic Era when the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart. Laurasia continued to fragment during the Mesozoic Era, eventually forming the continents we see today. Gondwana, on the other hand, was a southern supercontinent that consisted of present-day South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Arabian Peninsula. It formed during the Neoproterozoic Era, when earlier supercontinents began to break apart. Gondwana also continued to fragment during the Mesozoic Era, eventually forming the continents we see today. Laurasia and Gondwana were separated by the <dfn class="terminology">Tethys Sea</dfn>. The breakup of these supercontinents played a significant role in shaping the geography of the Earth and the evolution of life on the planet. For example, the separation of South America and Africa created an oceanic barrier that allowed different species to evolve independently. The separation of India from Antarctica and Australia led to the formation of the Himalayas.</div>
