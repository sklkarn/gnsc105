<dfn class="terminology">Shale</dfn> is a <em class="emphasis">fine-grained sedimentary rock</em> that is composed primarily of clay minerals, such as illite, kaolinite, and smectite, as well as other minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Shale is typically gray or black in color and has a laminated, or layered, appearance due to the parallel alignment of clay particles. It is often used as a source of oil and natural gas, as the fine-grained nature of the rock allows it to serve as a reservoir for hydrocarbons. Shale is also used as a building material, especially in regions where it is abundant. One of the unique properties of shale is its ability to split into thin, flat layers, a property known as fissility. This property makes shale useful as a building material and as a decorative stone in architecture. However, the high water content of shale can make it unstable, and it is prone to weathering and erosion over time.</div>
