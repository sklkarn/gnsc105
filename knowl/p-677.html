<dfn class="terminology">Anticyclones</dfn>, on the other hand, are areas of high pressure that are typically associated with clear skies, calm winds, and dry weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, anticyclones rotate clockwise and in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate counterclockwise. Anticyclones are often referred to as high-pressure systems and are associated with stable weather conditions. Both cyclones and anticyclones are important for weather forecasting because they can influence the movement of other weather systems. Cyclones, for example, can cause strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge, while anticyclones can cause calm winds, clear skies, and temperature inversions.</div>
