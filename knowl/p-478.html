<div class="para">Geometric optics is based on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light in which light is considered as a ray which travels in a straight line. Anything which emits light is known as object. Objects that emit light on their own are called a luminous (or self-luminous) objects such as sun, stars, light bulb, fireflies, etc. Objects that do not emit but reflect light are known as non-luminous objects such as moon, planets, wood, plastics, metals, etc.</div>
