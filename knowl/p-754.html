<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">hydronium ion</dfn>, also known as the oxonium ion, is a positively charged ion with the chemical formula <span class="process-math">\(H_3O^+\text{.}\)</span> It is formed when a water molecule, <span class="process-math">\(H_2O\text{,}\)</span> accepts a hydrogen ion, <span class="process-math">\(H^+\text{,}\)</span> from an acid. The hydronium ion is an important species in acid-base chemistry because it represents the acidic character of a solution. In aqueous solutions, the concentration of hydronium ions determines the pH of the solution. Solutions with a high concentration of hydronium ions have a low pH and are considered acidic, while solutions with a low concentration of hydronium ions have a high pH and are considered basic (alkaline). Hydronium ion can act as a proton donor (acid) or proton acceptor (base) in chemical reactions, making it an important species in acid-base catalysis. Pure water has some contents of hydronium ion when it dissociates but these ions recombines also very fast, hence, pure water is neutral and has pH scale of 7.</div>
