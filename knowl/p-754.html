<div class="para">An acid-base reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. In this type of reaction, the acid donates a proton (H+) to the base, which accepts the proton. This results in the formation of a new compound that is neither acidic nor basic in nature. <dfn class="terminology">Neutralization</dfn>  is a specific type of acid-base reaction where an acid and a base react to form a <dfn class="terminology">salt</dfn> and water. The salt formed is composed of the cation of the base and the anion of the acid, and it is typically a neutral compound. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the following reaction takes place:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
HCl + NaOH â†’ NaCl + H_2O
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this reaction, HCl is the acid, NaOH is the base, NaCl is the salt, and <span class="process-math">\(H_2O \)</span> is the water that is formed. The resulting solution is neutral because the <span class="process-math">\(H^+\)</span>  and <span class="process-math">\(OH^-\)</span> ions from the acid and base, respectively, have combined to form water, leaving behind only the <span class="process-math">\(Na^+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Cl^-\)</span> ions from the salt. Table salt <span class="process-math">\((NaCl)\text{,}\)</span> Epsom salt <span class="process-math">\((MgSO_4.7H_2O)\text{,}\)</span> Gypsom salt <span class="process-math">\((MgCaSO_4.2H_2O)\text{,}\)</span> Baking soda <span class="process-math">\((NaHCO_3)\)</span> are some examples of salt.</div>
