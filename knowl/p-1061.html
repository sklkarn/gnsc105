<div class="para">Solar energy is generated from the sun’s radiation through a process known as nuclear fusion [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nucfusionrxt.html" title="Figure 13.1.2.(b)">Figure 13.1.2.(b)</a>]. The high temperature and pressure in the core of a star cause the atomic nuclei to collide and merge to create a heavier nucleus and release energy in the process. The energy produced by the fusion reactions [<a href="subsec_7be-subsection.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.2.2: Binding Energy">Subsection 7.2.2</a>] <a class="external" href="https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/sunsolarenergy/fusion01.html" target="_blank">The Nuclear Fusion Reaction</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-73-hidden.html" title="Footnote 13.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> in a star is carried by radiation in the form of photons, which slowly make their way outwards from the core of the star. This energy is what powers the star and allows it to shine brightly in the sky. As a star ages and begins to run out of hydrogen fuel in its core, it may begin to undergo other fusion reactions that involve heavier elements. These reactions can produce even more energy, but eventually the star will exhaust all of its nuclear fuel and will either become a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole, depending on its mass.</div>
