<div class="para">Our solar system  <a class="external" href="https://3d-solar-system.webflow.io/" target="_blank">Solar System Animation</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-60-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. The birth of the sun, which is the center of the solar system <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-solarsys3.html" title="Figure 12.0.1.(a)">Figure 12.0.1.(a)</a>, began when a shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion triggered the collapse of a dense region of the nebula. This collapse caused the region to become hot and dense, and it eventually formed a protostar at its center. As the protostar continued to grow, it became increasingly hot and dense, until it reached a temperature and pressure high enough to initiate nuclear fusion. This process caused the protostar to emit energy in the form of light and heat, and it became a star <dfn class="terminology">the sun</dfn>. Meanwhile, the remaining gas and dust in the solar nebula began to clump together due to gravity, eventually forming the planets, moons, asteroids, and other objects that make up the solar system. The planets closer to the sun, also known as <dfn class="terminology">inner planets or Terrestrial planets</dfn> such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are rocky and relatively small, while the <dfn class="terminology">outer planets or Jovian planets</dfn> such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are much larger and composed mainly of gas and ice. This process of planetary formation took place over hundreds of millions of years and is still ongoing, as smaller objects continue to collide and form into larger ones.</div>
