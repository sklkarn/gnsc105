<div class="para">Rocks are made up of one or more minerals but it does not have a definite chemical compositions. The three types of rocks are given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rocks.html" title="Figure 11.2.3">Figure 11.2.3</a>.</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Igneous rocks</dfn> are formed from the solidification of magma or lava, and they make up a significant portion of the Earth's crust. Common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian. Igneous rocks can form either on the Earth's surface (extrusive) or beneath the surface (intrusive). Hence, it is of two types. <dfn class="terminology">Extrusive igneous rocks</dfn>, such as basalt and andesite, are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies quickly on the Earth's surface. These rocks often have a fine-grained texture because the rapid cooling does not allow time for large crystals to form. <dfn class="terminology">Intrusive igneous rocks</dfn>, such as granite and gabbro, are formed when magma cools and solidifies slowly beneath the Earth's surface. These rocks often have a coarse-grained texture because the slow cooling allows time for large crystals to form. Igneous rocks provide valuable information about the Earth's history and geologic processes. For example, the composition of igneous rocks can give insight into the conditions and processes that led to their formation, such as volcanic activity or the melting and mixing of different rock types. Igneous rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals and metals, such as copper, gold, and silver.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Sedimentary rocks</dfn> are formed from the accumulation and cementation of sedimentary particles such as sand, silt, and clay. It is formed in layers. Examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, shale, and limestone. Sedimentary rocks cover about 75% of the Earth's surface, and they are the most common type of rock found at the Earth's surface. Sedimentary rocks provide clues about the Earth's history, such as the type of environment in which they were formed and the types of organisms that lived during that time. For example, fossils found in sedimentary rocks provide valuable information about the evolution of life on Earth. Sedimentary rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals and resources, such as oil, gas, and coal. <dfn class="terminology">Fragmental and conglomerate</dfn> sedimentary rocks are  formed from the accumulation and lithification of rock fragments and other debris.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Metamorphic rocks</dfn> are formed from the transformation of existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks) due to heat, pressure, or chemical activity, without melting. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, slate, and gneiss. Metamorphic rocks can form deep beneath the Earth's surface, where they are subjected to extreme temperatures and pressures, or closer to the surface, where they are exposed to hot fluids or intense deformation. Metamorphic rocks can be classified into two main types: <dfn class="terminology">foliated and non-foliated</dfn>. Foliated metamorphic rocks, such as slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss, have a layered or banded appearance due to the alignment of mineral grains under pressure. Non-foliated metamorphic rocks, such as marble and quartzite, do not have a layered or banded appearance and are typically composed of a single mineral or mineral type. The texture and composition of metamorphic rocks can also provide information about the tectonic environment and geologic history of the region in which they formed. Metamorphic rocks provide valuable information about the Earth's history and geologic processes. For example, they can provide evidence of past mountain-building events and the movement of tectonic plates. Metamorphic rocks are also important economically, as they are a source of many valuable minerals, such as gold, silver, and copper.
