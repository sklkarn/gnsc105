<div class="para">In real life frictional forces are almost always present. <em class="emphasis">Remember</em> the direction of frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion or the applied force. Friction is bad as it dissipates energy but friction is also good as it allows us to roll, turn, walk, and stop. Friction between two solids does not depend on the surface area in contact. Friction can happen, even between surfaces that are not solid such as air drag. <em class="alert">Air resistance (drag)</em> during free fall reduces the weight of the object. Air drag (resistance) increases with the velocity of the object in free fall and when it becomes equal to the wight of the object, net force acting on the object is zero and hence the object starts falling with the constant velocity called <dfn class="terminology">Terminal Velocity.</dfn> Skydiving is a good example of terminal velocity.</div>
