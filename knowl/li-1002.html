<dfn class="terminology">Calcite:</dfn> Calcite is a carbonate mineral that is commonly found in sedimentary rocks such as limestone and marble. It is composed of calcium carbonate <span class="process-math">\((CaCO_3)\)</span> and it is relatively soft. Calcite has many unique properties, including its ability to exhibit birefringence, a phenomenon where light passing through the mineral is split into two different rays, which can produce a double image. It is also fluorescent under ultraviolet light, and some varieties can even exhibit phosphorescence, meaning they continue to glow after the light source is removed.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_eleventh-rockminr.html#li-1002" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
