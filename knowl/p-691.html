<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">tsunami</dfn> is a series of ocean waves with very long wavelengths (hundred of kilometers long) caused by large-scale disturbances of the ocean due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or underwater landslides. Tsunamis can also be generated by large meteorite impacts or nuclear explosions in the ocean. When a large disturbance occurs, it can create a series of waves that radiate outwards from the source. These waves can travel across entire ocean basins and can cause significant damage when they reach shore. Tsunami waves can reach heights of tens of meters, and their high energy can devastate coastal communities, causing flooding, erosion, and destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Tsunamis travel at high speeds, with typical speeds of around 700 kilometers per hour in deep water. Because of their high speed and long wavelength, they can pass unnoticed in the open ocean, with wave heights typically only a few centimeters. However, as the waves approach shallow waters near the coast, they slow down and the wave height increases, creating a wall of water that can inundate coastal areas.</div>
