<dfn class="terminology">Hubble's law</dfn>   describes the relationship between the distance to a galaxy and its observed redshift. The law states that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us. This relationship is described by the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v = H_0 \times d,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(v \)</span> is the velocity of the galaxy, <span class="process-math">\(d \)</span> is its distance from us, and <span class="process-math">\(H_0\)</span>  is the Hubble constant, which is a measure of the rate at which the Universe is expanding. The Hubble constant has been determined through observations of distant galaxies and is currently estimated to be around <dfn class="terminology">73 kilometers per second per megaparsec</dfn>. This means that for every megaparsec (about 3.26 million light-years) of distance, a galaxy appears to be moving away from us at a rate of 73 kilometers per second. The discovery of Hubble's law revolutionized our understanding of the Universe and led to the development of the Big Bang theory. Hubble's law provides strong evidence that the Universe is expanding, and that it began with a single, explosive event around 13.8 billion years ago.</div>
