<div class="para">In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in figure below. Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 30%; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;"><img src="external/fig2d.png" class="contained"></div>
