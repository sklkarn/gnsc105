<div class="para">Radioactivity  is the process of spontaneous decay of an atomic nucleus. In this process, an unstable nucleus breaks apart into smaller and more stable nuclei. This process releases energy in the form of ionizing radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Some radioactive isotopes are naturally occurring, while others can be produced artificially, for example, in nuclear reactors. Radioactivity plays many applications in medicine (e.g., medical imaging, cancer treatment), energy production (e.g., nuclear power plants), and research (e.g., dating of rocks and artifacts). Since radiactivity releases harmful radiation along with energy, it may cause harmful effect to health. Hence, it could be handled very carefully and responsibly. Radioactivity occurs due to the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for beta decay, where a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. Due to the weak nuclear force a neutron is converted into a proton by emitting beta particle which changes the atomic number of the atom and the identity of the element. However, radioactivities like alpha decay and gamma decay are not directly related to the weak nuclear force. Alpha decay is caused by the strong nuclear force, which holds the nucleus together, while gamma decay is a result of a change in the energy level of the nucleus.</div>
