<div class="para">The discovery of the periodic table is generally attributed to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who published his version of the table in 1869. However, other scientists, including John Newlands and Julius Lothar Meyer, also made significant contributions to the development of the periodic table around the same time. Mendeleev’s table was particularly influential because he left gaps for undiscovered elements and predicted the properties of these elements based on their position in the table. When these elements were discovered, their properties were found to match Mendeleev’s predictions, which helped to establish the credibility of the periodic table <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-ptable.html" title="Figure 8.2.1">Figure 8.2.1</a>.</div>
