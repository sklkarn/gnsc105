<div class="para">The balloon analogy <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-expans.html" title="Figure 14.1.3">FigureÂ 14.1.3</a> is often used to explain the expansion of the universe. In this analogy, the universe is represented by the surface of a balloon, and as the balloon is inflated, all points on the surface move away from each other. In this analogy, the size of the balloon represents the size of the universe, and the dots on the surface represent galaxies. As the balloon expands, the distance between any two dots (galaxies) increases. This is similar to how the distance between any two galaxies in the universe is increasing due to the expansion of the universe.</div>
