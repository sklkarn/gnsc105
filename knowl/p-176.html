<div class="para">Angular momentum is the momentum associated with a body in rotation about some axis. It is also a vector quantity. The direction of angular momentum is parallel to the axis of rotation. Spinning ball or rotating wheel has an angular momentum. Angular momentum is represented by, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> Angular momentum is defined by <span class="process-math">\(L=I\omega\text{.}\)</span> Where <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is called moment of inertia and <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> is called the rotational velocity of the object. Moment of inertia, <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> tells us that how the mass of a body is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. It is the property of a material that restrict it to have any change in its rotation state of motion.</div>
