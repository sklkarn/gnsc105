<div class="para">Caves are formed by various geological processes, such as erosion, weathering, and dissolution of rocks. The most common type of cave is a solution cave, which is formed in soluble rocks, such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, by the action of water and acids. When rainwater or groundwater passes through soil and vegetation, it becomes slightly acidic due to the presence of carbon dioxide. This slightly acidic water can dissolve the soluble minerals in rocks, creating cracks and fissures. Over time, these cracks and fissures can widen and form underground channels and caverns.</div>
