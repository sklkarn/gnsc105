<div class="para">Carbon is an element that has several isotopes. Some of them are carbon-12 (or, <span class="process-math">\({}_6^{12}C\)</span>) and carbon-13 (or, <span class="process-math">\({}_6^{13}C\)</span>), and carbon-14 (or, <span class="process-math">\({}_6^{14}C\)</span>). Carbon-12 and carbon-13, are naturally occurring isotopes and make up the majority of carbon on Earth. Carbon-12, has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and is the most abundant in nature. Carbon-12 is considered the standard for atomic mass. Carbon-13, has 6 protons and 7 neutrons and is a stable isotope. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total carbon on Earth. Carbon-14 is a naturally occurring isotope that is produced in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere through cosmic radiation and is taken up by living organisms. It is used in the radiocarbon dating method to determine the age of organic materials and is an important tool in archaeology and other fields.</div>
