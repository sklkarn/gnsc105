<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">meteor shower</dfn> occurs when the Earth passes through a trail of debris left behind by a comet or asteroid. As the Earth moves through this debris field, the small particles, called meteoroids, enter the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds and burn up, creating streaks of light in the sky that we call <dfn class="terminology">meteors or shooting stars</dfn>. Meteor showers can occur at various times throughout the year, and they are often named after the constellation that appears to be the source of the meteors (the radiant). Some of the most well-known meteor showers include the Perseids (in August), the Leonids (in November), and the Geminids (in December).</div>
