<div class="para">Tectonic movement refers to the movement of large sections of the Earthâ€™s lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth that consists of the crust and uppermost part of the mantle) relative to each other. The lithosphere is broken up into a number of plates that move around on the underlying asthenosphere (the partially molten, ductile region of the mantle). Tectonic movement occurs primarily at plate boundaries, where plates interact with each other. There are three types of plate boundaries: <dfn class="terminology">Divergent boundaries:</dfn> where plates move away from each other, creating new crust. This occurs mainly at mid-ocean ridges. <dfn class="terminology">Convergent boundaries:</dfn> where plates move towards each other and one plate is usually subducted (forced beneath) the other. This can cause earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain-building. <dfn class="terminology">Transform boundaries:</dfn> where plates slide past each other horizontally. This can also cause earthquakes. Tectonic movement is driven by the movement of molten rock in the mantle, which creates convection currents that move the plates.</div>
