<div class="para">Brightness and luminosity are important factors in determining the distance of stars. <dfn class="terminology">Brightness</dfn>, also known as apparent magnitude, is a measure of how bright a star appears to an observer on Earth. It is affected by the distance of the star, as well as other factors such as its size and temperature. A star's brightness can be measured using a magnitude scale, with lower numbers indicating brighter stars and higher numbers indicating dimmer stars. <dfn class="terminology">Luminosity</dfn>, on the other hand, is a measure of the total amount of energy that a star emits per unit time. It is related to the star's size, temperature, and distance. Luminosity can be measured in terms of the sun's luminosity, which is a standard unit of measurement.</div>
