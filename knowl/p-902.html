<dfn class="terminology">Slate</dfn> Slate is a <em class="emphasis">fine-grained metamorphic rock</em> that is derived from shale or mudstone. It is composed primarily of clay minerals such as illite, chlorite, and muscovite, along with small amounts of quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and other minerals. Slate typically has a flat, smooth surface and is highly fissile, meaning it can be split into thin, durable sheets. It is often gray in color, but can also be green, black, or red, depending on the minerals present. Slate can be used as a roofing material, flooring, and as a decorative stone in architecture. Slate forms from the compaction and recrystallization of clay and other fine-grained sedimentary rocks under high pressure and temperature. The pressure causes the clay minerals to reorient themselves into thin, parallel layers, which gives slate its characteristic fissility (fissility is the property of a rock to split easily along thin closely spaced parallel layers). The minerals present in the original sedimentary rock, as well as the degree and duration of heat and pressure, determine the color and texture of the resulting slate. Slate is known for its durability, resistance to weathering and erosion, and fire resistance, which makes it a popular choice for roofing and other construction applications.</div>
