<div class="para">When a stone is thrown in a quiet pond a number of nice circular rings, called ripples emerge on the surface of water which grow gently and move across the pond in a concentric pattern. These growing ripples are called a wave which carries energy from the point of stone thrown to the edge of a pond. Hence a wave can be defined as a disturbance in space that can carry energy from one location to another. A wave creates in a medium when a medium is trying to regain its equilibrium state (normal position). When a stone is thrown it transfers its energy to the surface of water due to which water layer stretches downwards till stone dips down that layer of water. When stone leaves the water layer, water wants to recover its original position to maintain equilibrium due to surface tension but as it reaches to the original position it keeps raising upward because of inertia and stretches the water surface again till it reaches the maximum height. Now due to surface tension this layer of water gets pulled down again and starts falling down below the equilibrium position due to inertia such procedure is the cause of waves (disturbances) on water. Energy propagates two ways in water one way is due to vertical up and down motion of water surface and another way is a back and forth motion of water molecules inside the water. Similar to concentric circles on water surface energy transmitted in space in the form of concentric spheres. Figure below <a class="external" href="http://www.falstad.com/ripple/" target="_blank">ripples in wave</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-22-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> shows the same disturbances traveling away from the center as a series of successive wavefronts labeled crests and troughs. A wavefront is a locus of points along which all phases and displacements are identical. The solid circles depict the outward-moving wave crests; the dashed circles represent wave troughs. Adjacent crests are always a wavelength apart, as are the adjacent troughs. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">
