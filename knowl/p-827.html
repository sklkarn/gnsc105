<dfn class="terminology">Lunar Layers:</dfn> The outermost layer of the Moon is composed of a layer of rock called the regolith. The regolith is made up of small rock fragments and dust that have been broken down over time by the impact of meteoroids and the bombardment of charged particles from the Sun. Beneath the regolith, the Moon is composed of several distinct layers. The outermost layer is the crust, which is about 30-40 km thick and is composed of a mixture of rocks, including basalt and anorthosite. Beneath the crust is the mantle, which extends to a depth of about 1,000 km. The mantle is composed of denser rocks than the crust and contains a small amount of partially molten material. Finally, at the center of the Moon is a metallic core, which is thought to be about 800 km in diameter. The composition and structure of the Moon's interior have been studied through a variety of methods, including seismic measurements from Apollo missions, observations of the Moon's gravity field, and computer simulations. These studies have helped to refine our understanding of the Moon's formation and evolution, as well as its potential for future scientific exploration and resource utilization.</div>
